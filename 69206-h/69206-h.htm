<small>DUD WONDERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jimmy Logan stood his skis in the corner
behind the door and, tramping heavily to get
the clinging snow from his shoes, climbed the
first flight in Trow Hall slowly and then dragged
wearied feet down the corridor to Number 19.
Once inside the room, he said, “Hello,” shied his
cap onto his bed and sank exhaustedly in the nearest
chair, stretching his legs across the rug and slumping
down until the wet collar of his mackinaw came
in contact with his ears. Whereupon he muttered,
“Ugh!” and sat up another inch or two.</p>

<p>Across the room, one foot on the floor and the
other doubled up beneath him on the windowseat,
was Jimmy’s roommate. His response to the greeting
had been brief and delivered in a preoccupied
voice, for Dudley Baker had a book open before
him on the cushion and held a stained and battered
baseball in his right hand. His attention was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
divided between book and ball and had no room
for Jimmy. The latter’s gaze presently came away
from his shoes, which were trickling water to the
rug, and fixed itself on Dudley. He had to sit up
still higher in the chair to get an uninterrupted view
of his chum, which proceeding elicited a protesting
groan from him, and after he had attained it he instantly
decided that it was not worth while and
deeply regretted the exertion it had caused him.
He promptly descended again on his spine, crossed
his feet and sighed luxuriously.</p>

<p>The dollar clock on Dudley’s chiffonier ticked
briskly and loudly in the ensuing silence. Outside
the windows tiny flakes of snow were falling. The
shadows deepened in the room. In the corridor
deliberate footsteps sounded and suddenly the transom
over the door showed yellow and an oblong
of light appeared on the ceiling. Mr. Crump, the
school janitor, was lighting the dormitories. Jimmy
wished that his shoes were off, and his mackinaw,
and the woolen socks, but as yet he wasn’t equal to
the task. When Mr. Crump’s footsteps had died
away on the stairs Jimmy broke the silence.</p>

<p>“What’re you doing?” he asked uninterestedly.
There was, however, no reply from the window-seat,
possibly because Jimmy’s tones had been too
faint to reach there. After a moment Jimmy turned
his head and stared across a pile of books on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
study table at the three or four inches of Dudley’s
head that were visible. Then:</p>

<p>“<em>Dud!</em>” he bawled resentfully.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“What are you doing, I asked you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, me? Oh, just trying to dope out some of
this stuff.”</p>

<p>“What stuff?”</p>

<p>“Stuff about pitching. How to hold the ball, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Jimmy subsided again and another period
of silence followed. Then:</p>

<p>“You don’t expect to play baseball for a while,
do you?” he asked lazily. “You’d better study how
to throw a snowball!” He chuckled faintly at his
joke.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so long now,” responded Dud soberly.
“They’re going to call candidates the twenty-first.”</p>

<p>“Gym work,” grunted the other. “Take my advice
and keep away from it. Don’t go out for the
team until it gets out of doors. Are you still thinking
of trying for the school?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>Jimmy grunted. “You’ll have a fine show, I don’t
think! Better try for the second, Dud.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to make it, but it’s good practice,
and maybe next year——”</p>

<p>“You’ll stand more chance with the second, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
have a lot more fun. The second’s going to have
a regular schedule this year; five or six games, maybe;
going away for some of them, too.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t make the first, and I suppose I
won’t, of course, I’ll try for the second,” said
Dud. “I asked Murtha this morning if he thought
it would be all right to try for the first, and he
said——”</p>

<p>“Guy Murtha said, ‘Yes, indeed, Baker, we want
all the candidates we can get!’ That’s what they
always tell you, and then, when you get out there,
they inform you gently but firmly that you won’t
do, and hadn’t you better stay with your class team
this year and try again next? What’s the use? I
like to play ball, Dud, but you don’t catch me putting
in a month’s grind in the cage and then getting
the G. B. as soon as we get outdoors. Me for the
second—and safety.”</p>

<p>“You’re lazy,” replied Dud, shutting his book
and stowing the ball back of the pillows. “You
could make the first this spring if you’d try for it.
You ought to, too.”</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. “Maybe so. But I’d rather
have a sure place on the second, thanks. Gee, but
I’m tired!”</p>

<p>“Skiing?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Pete Gordon and Kelly and Gus and I.
We climbed up to the Observatory and then hiked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
half-way over to the Falls. It was piles of fun
going down the mountain. Gus Weston took a
header and turned over about forty-eleven times and
then went into a snow bank head-first up to his waist.
But we tried to do too much. My legs feel as if
they’d never stop aching! What have you been
doing? Been in here all the afternoon? But, of
course, you have. I forgot about your tooth. How
is it? Any better?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I guess I caught a little cold in it. I wish
that dentist chap would yank it out instead of practicing
on it!” Dud turned the lights on and perched
himself across a chair at the opposite side of the
table, his arms on the back, and observed Jimmy in
a thoughtful fashion. Jimmy grunted.</p>

<p>“Shoot,” he said. “What’s on your mind?”</p>

<p>“I—I’ve been wondering, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gee!” Jimmy groaned deeply. “At it
again, eh? Well, what is it this time, Dud? The
other day you were worrying yourself thin because
you were afraid you were costing your folks too
much money, or something.”</p>

<p>Dud smiled. “Not exactly worrying,” he replied.
“Just—just wondering.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much difference, the way you do it.
If I——”</p>

<p>“Not so much about how much I was costing
them as whether they’re going to get their money’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
worth, Jimmy. Sometimes I wonder whether I’m
really doing any good here. Now you look at it
this way——”</p>

<p>“I won’t! I refuse! Besides, that’s an old one.
What’s your latest worry?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a worry—exactly. I was only thinking
that——” He paused. Then: “Oh, I guess it
isn’t anything, after all. Say, you’d better get out
of those wet things, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to just as soon as I have strength to
move. But I want to hear your new—er—problem,
Dud. Come across. ’Fess up to your Uncle
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Dud hesitated, smiling a bit embarrassedly. He
was a good-looking chap of fifteen, with clean-cut
features, a rather fair complexion and very bright
blue eyes. He was small-boned and slim, and, since
he had been doing a lot of growing the past twelve
months, he looked a trifle “weedy.” In that respect
he was a distinct contrast to his roommate, for
James Townsend Logan was a stocky lad, wide of
shoulder and broad of chest. Jimmy was sixteen, although
only four months divided the two boys in age.
Jimmy’s features were nondescript, but the result
was pleasing. He wore his red-brown hair rather
long—Dud said it was because he was too lazy to
have it cut oftener than once every term—and had a
short nose and a wide, humorous mouth and a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
square chin. He was a member of the upper middle
class, while Dud was a lower middler.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s sort of silly,” said Dud after a moment.
“But I’ve been wondering”—Jimmy groaned
again—“why I don’t know more fellows, Jimmy,
why I don’t—don’t ‘mix’ better. I don’t believe I
really care a whole lot——” He paused again.
“Yes I do, too, though. I’d like to have fellows like
me, Jimmy, as they do you, and ask me to do things
and go places and—and all that. Of course, I know
the trouble’s with me, all right, but—but what is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle, Dud! Fellows <em>do</em> like you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, about the way they like the steps in front
of School Hall. That is, they don’t exactly <em>like</em>
me; they just—just don’t <em>dislike</em> me. I guess I’d
rather have them do that than not care a fig whether
I’m alive or dead. I suppose this sounds silly,
but——”</p>

<p>“Honest confession is good for the soul,” responded
Jimmy lightly. “But I think you’re wrong
about it, Dud. Or, anyway—now look here——”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m just not cut out to be what you
might call popular,” interrupted Dud thoughtfully.
“Well, but still——”</p>

<p>“Shut up and let me talk! The trouble with you
is that you don’t let fellows find out whether they
can like you or not. You don’t—don’t ‘mix’—do
you see? If you’d get into things more——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“But that’s just it! How can I when I see that
I’m not wanted?”</p>

<p>“That’s just imagination, Dud. You can’t expect
fellows to fall all over themselves and hug
you! You’ve got to show ’em that you’re ready
to be friends. You’ve got to make the start yourself.
What do you do when someone says ‘Let’s
do this or that’? You mutter something about having
to dig Latin or math and sneak off. Fellows
naturally think you don’t want to do the things
they do. Now today, for instance——”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have gone, Jimmy, with this plaguey
toothache!”</p>

<p>“Why, no, I guess you couldn’t. But, thunderation,
Dud, if it isn’t a toothache it’s something else.
You’ve always got some perfectly wonderful excuse
for beating it about the time the fun begins.
Not that you missed much this afternoon, for you
didn’t, barring a lot of tired muscles, but you often
do miss things. To be what you call a ‘mixer,’ Dud,
you’ve got to ‘mix,’ and you don’t know the first
thing about it. Fellows like you, all right, what
they see of you, but you don’t give them a
chance.”</p>

<p>Dud stared thoughtfully at the green shade before
him. “Ye-yes, I suppose that’s true, Jimmy.
But I don’t like to stick around when fellows are
getting up things because I think that maybe they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
won’t want me in on it and that if I’m there they’ll
think they have to ask me.”</p>

<p>“Huh! What if they do have to ask you? Let
’em! Then when they see that you’re a regular
feller they’ll ask you next time without having to.”</p>

<p>“But I wonder if I am.”</p>

<p>“Am what?” asked Jimmy ungrammatically.</p>

<p>“A ‘regular feller.’ Maybe I’m not. I wonder——”</p>

<p>Jimmy threw up his hands in despair. “Oh, gee,
he’s at it again! Dud, what you want to do is
stop wondering. You’re the finest little wonderer
that ever came down the pike, all right, but you
spend so much time at it that you don’t get anywhere.
Now, you take my advice, old chap, and
stop wondering whether fellows like you or don’t
like you. Just get out and butt in a little. When
you see a crowd walk right into the middle of it
and find out whether it’s a fight or a frolic. And,
whatever it is, take a hand. Now there’s some
mighty good advice, Dud, take it from me. I didn’t
know I had it in me! And let me tell you another
thing, kid. If you expect to have a show for the
first team you want to crawl out of your shell and
rub shoulders with fellows. Get hunky with the
first team crowd, do you see? Be—be more of a—well,
more of a regular feller, like I said before.
Don’t try too hard to be popular, though. Fellows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
get onto that and won’t stand for it. Just—just
be natural!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m being natural,” answered Dud, with
a smile, “and that is where the trouble is. I guess
I’ll have to wait until next year. A lower middle
fellow feels sort of fresh if he tries to mix in with
upper middlers.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Lots of your class are thick as thieves
with upper middle chaps. Look at young Whatshisname—Stiles.
He’s always traveling with upper
middlers—Ordway and Blake and that bunch.”</p>

<p>“Ned Stiles has more cheek than I have. Besides,
I don’t think fellows like him particularly,
Jimmy. He sort of toadies, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He’s a perfect ass, if you ask me. But they
seem to stand for him.”</p>

<p>“Well, but I don’t want to be ‘stood for’; I want
fellows to—to want me.”</p>

<p>“All right. Give ’em a chance then. You’re
all right, Dud, only you’re shy. That’s what’s the
matter with you, old chap, you’re just plain shy!
Never thought of it before. Look here, now, I’ll
tell you what you do. You forget all about your
dear little self and get over being—being—gee,
what’s the word I want? Being self-conscious!
That’s it! That’s your trouble, self-consciousness.”
Jimmy beamed approval at himself. “Best way to
do it is to—to do it! Tell you what, we’ll make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
a start tonight, eh? Let’s go out and visit someone.
Who do you know that you’d like to know
better?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know Hugh Ordway, for one,” said
Dud hesitatingly. “But I guess he wouldn’t care
about knowing me, and so——”</p>

<p>“Stow it! That’s just what you mustn’t do, do
you see? You mustn’t ‘wonder’ whether a fellow
wants to know you or not. You just take it for
granted that he does. Say to yourself, ‘I’m a good
feller, a regular feller. I’m as good as you are.
Of course you want to know me. Why not?’ See
the idea?”</p>

<p>Dud nodded doubtfully. “Still, Hugh Ordway’s
a bit——”</p>

<p>“A bit what?” demanded Jimmy impatiently.</p>

<p>“I mean he’s awfully popular and has piles of
friends and he wouldn’t be likely to—to want to
know me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! Ordway’s just like any of us—except
that he happens to be English and have a
Lord or a Duke or something for a father. I don’t
know him very well myself, but that’s just because
he trains with the football crowd—Blake and Winslow
and that bunch. But I know him plenty well
enough to visit, and that’s just what we’ll do this
evening, Dud.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better leave it for some other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
night,” replied Dud uneasily. “I’ve got a lot of
lessons tonight and——”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Jimmy mirthlessly. “Where
have I heard that before?” He pulled himself from
his chair with a groan and pointed a stern finger
at his chum. “You’ll start right in with me this
very evening, Dud, and be a regular feller! And
no more punk excuses, either! I’m going to take
you in hand, son, and when I get through with
you you won’t know yourself. Here, <em>stop that</em>!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Dud startledly.</p>

<p>“You know what! You were beginning to wonder!
I saw you! No more of that, understand?
The first time I catch you wondering I’ll—I’ll take
my belt to you!”</p>

<p class="cap">If you have by any chance read a previous narrative
of events at Grafton School entitled
“Rivals for the Team” you are sufficiently acquainted
with the scene of this story, and, also,
with many of the characters. But since it is quite
possible that you have never even heard of the
former narrative, it devolves on the historian to
introduce a certain amount of descriptive matter at
about this stage, something he has as little taste
for as have you. Descriptions are always tiresome,
and so we’ll have this as short as possible.</p>

<p>Grafton School, then, occupies a matter of ten
acres a half-mile east of the town of that name
and at the foot of the hill which is known as Mount
Grafton. Like many another New England school,
it is shaded by elms, boasts many fine expanses of
velvety turf and, so to speak, laves its feet in a
gently-flowing river. The buildings on the campus
consist of three dormitories, the more venerable
School Hall, the gymnasium and the Principal’s
residence, and of these all save the two latter stretch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
in a straight line across the middle of the three-acre
expanse. The gymnasium is slightly back from
the line and the Principal’s cottage is a bit in advance,
its vine-covered porch looking along the
fronts of the other buildings and its rear windows
peering down into Crumbie Street. School Hall is
in the center. Trow comes next on the left, and then
Lothrop. On the right of the older building stands
Manning, which shelters the younger boys, and
somewhat “around the corner” is the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Graveled walks lead across the campus, under
spreading elm trees, to Crumbie Street on one side,
to River Street on the other, to School Street straight
in front. Beyond School Street is the Green, a
block-wide parallelogram on which, at the corner
of School and River Streets, two smaller dormitories
stand. These, Morris and Fuller, are converted
dwellings of limited accommodations. The
main walk from the steps of School Hall continues
across the Green to Front Street, beyond which, descending
gently to the Needham River, is Lothrop
Field. An ornamental wall and gate commemorate
the name of the giver. The Field House
flanks the steps on the left and beyond lie the football
gridirons, the baseball diamonds, the tennis
courts and the blue-gray cinder track. The distant
weather-stained building on the river bank is the
boathouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>Grafton School looks after slightly over two hundred
boys between the ages of twelve and twenty.
At the time of which I am writing, February of
last year, the number was, I believe, exactly two
hundred and ten, of which some thirty-five had attained
to the senior class and about eighty were
juniors, leaving the upper middle and lower middle
classes to share the residue fairly equally. The
faculty numbered twelve, beginning with Doctor
Duncan, the Principal, and ending with Mrs. Fair,
the matron. Doctor Duncan’s full title is Charles
William Duncan, A.M., Ph.D., but he is better
known as “Charley”! There was—and doubtless
are—also a Mrs. Duncan and a Miss Duncan, but
they are not likely to enter into this narrative. So
much then for our stage setting. I might keep
on, but I fear you are weary, and I know I am!</p>

<p>Hugh Ordway roomed on the top floor of Lothrop,
the newest and most luxurious of the dormitories,
sharing the suite of study and two bedrooms
with Bert Winslow. Hugh’s father was English
and his mother American, and, although Hugh had
been born on the other side and had spent most of
his sixteen years there, he declared himself to be half
American. His full name was Hugh Oswald Brodwick
Ordway, and in spite of the fact that by reason
of his father being the Marquis of Lockely,
Hugh had every right to the title of Earl of Ordway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
he was generally known at Grafton as “Hobo,” a
nickname evolved from his initials. As he was a
straight, well-built, clear-skinned, young chap with
quiet brown eyes and an undeniable air of breeding,
the nickname was amusingly incongruous if one
stopped to consider it. But Hugh had been known
as Hobo Ordway ever since fall, when his cleverness
as a running halfback on the first football team
had surprised and delighted the school, and nowadays
the name was too familiar to excite any comment.
Hugh’s particular friends were more likely
to call him “’Ighness,” however.</p>

<p>It was Hugh, alone in the study, who responded
to the knock at the door shortly after supper that
evening and who successfully disguised the surprise
he felt when he recognized his visitors as Jimmy
Logan and Dudley Baker. He made them welcome
quite as heartily as though he had been expecting
them all day, and Dud, who had hung back all the
way up the three flights of slate stairs, was vastly
relieved. The conversation skipped from one subject
to another for the first few minutes, during
which time Hugh, perched on the window-seat, leaving
the easy-chairs to his guests, hugged his knees
to his chin, piloted the conversation and secretly
wondered at the visit.</p>

<p>You are not to suppose, however, that Hugh was
the only one of the three at his ease. Such a supposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
shows on your part a vast ignorance of
Jimmy Logan. Jimmy was a stranger to embarrassment.
Had Hugh been the President of the
United States or the King of England or—well,
“Home Run” Baker, Jimmy would have been just
as splendidly at ease as he was this moment. He
might have assumed a more dignified attitude in the
Morris chair and his voice might have held a more
respectful tone, but beyond that—no, not Jimmy!
Just now Jimmy was humorously recounting his
skiing adventures that afternoon and Hugh was
chuckling over them. Dud smiled when Hugh
laughed, sitting rather stiffly in his chair, and tried
his best to look animated and pleasant and only
succeeded in looking anxious and uncomfortable.
Jimmy did his best to get Dud to talk, but Dud’s
conversation consisted largely of “Yes” and “No”
and Hugh secretly thought him a bit of a stick.
Jimmy was wondering whether to withdraw as gracefully
as possible before Dud created any worse impression
when the door opened to admit a black-haired,
dark-eyed fellow of seventeen who, with
less command over his features than Hugh, looked
frankly surprised when he saw who the visitors
were. The surprise even extended to his voice as
he greeted them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jimmy,” said Bert Winslow. “What
are you doing up here? Haven’t seen you around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
here for ages.” He spoke to Dud then, hesitating
a moment as though not certain of the latter’s name.
Dud, noting the fact, felt his embarrassment increase
and wished that Jimmy would give the word
to leave. But Jimmy had already abandoned
thoughts of withdrawing. He liked Bert Winslow,
just as most fellows did, and welcomed the chance
to talk to him. Bert and Jimmy were both members
of “Lit”—short for Literary Society—and only
two evenings ago had been pitted against each other
in one of the impromptu weekly debates and had
struggled along nip and tuck until Jimmy, abandoning
facts, had in a wild flow of rhetoric won the
meeting. Bert alluded to it now as he tossed his
cap through the open door of his bedroom.</p>

<p>“Jimmy, that was a fine lot of hot air you got
off the other night,” he said with a grin. “Didn’t
your folks ever teach you anything about the beauties
of truthfulness?”</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed. “Sure, but I had to beat you
somehow, Bert. Besides, what I said may be so
for all I know!”</p>

<p>“Huh! You just said the first thing that came
into that silly head of yours! Did you ever hear
such a mess of rot as he sprang, Hugh?”</p>

<p>Hugh smiled. “It sounded all right! Some of
the figures were corking. You must have a wonderful
memory, Logan!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“Memory!” snorted Bert, seating himself beside
Hugh on the window-seat. “There wasn’t a figure
that was right! I looked it up afterwards. Did
you hear him, Baker? Oh, no, you’re Forum, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dud. He tried very hard to follow
that up with something brilliant or amusing
in regard to Jimmy’s debating, but couldn’t think
of anything, possibly because Bert’s tone had held
some of the careless contempt with which members
of a society spoke of its rival, and Dud wished
just for the moment that he, too, was “Lit.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Hugh thought that his chum had verged
on discourtesy, for he observed quickly: “They
tell me you chaps have some awfully good talkers
in Forum, Baker.”</p>

<p>Dud agreed. “I guess Joe Leslie is our best;
he and Guy Murtha.”</p>

<p>“Murtha’s better than Joe, I think,” said Jimmy.
“Anyway, he did a lot better last year in the debate
with Mount Morris.”</p>

<p>“Joe’s a wonder at hammering home facts,” said
Bert. “Guy’s better at the eloquence stuff, though.
Speaking of Guy, Hugh, reminds me that I told
him you were going to try for the outfield this spring
and he said he was mighty glad because if you
could get on the base he was certain you could get
around.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but I say, Bert, I don’t know that I shall!
Try for baseball, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Of course you will!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know much about it. You say it’s
quite different from cricket, eh?”</p>

<p>“Quite, ’Ighness! You’ve seen baseball played,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, once or twice, but——”</p>

<p>“I should think a fair cricket player would easily
get the hang of baseball,” said Jimmy. “I guess
it’s as hard to catch a cricket ball as a baseball, isn’t
it? I suppose you’re a rattling good cricket player,
Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, really I’m not,” exclaimed Hugh. “I’ve
played a bit at it, of course. You chaps bowl—I
mean pitch to the batters so like thunder, don’t you?
I fancy I’ll be scared to stand up there, eh?”</p>

<p>“You might if Gus Weston was pitching,” laughed
Bert. “You going to play this year, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so. What would the dear old second
do without me?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you trying for the first, though? You’re
as good a fielder as Parker, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I may. The fact is, Bert, I’m sort of used to
the dear old second. It would be like leaving home
to go to the first. Still, I may decide to break home
ties and meet you fellows there.”</p>

<p>“I fancy you’re not likely to meet me there,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
said Hugh. “I’ll be an awful dub if I try it, I know.
Do you play, Baker?”</p>

<p>“A little,” answered Dud.</p>

<p>“Dud’s the coming Mathewson,” said Jimmy.
“Got to watch him, we have. Some twirler!”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Bert, evidently not much impressed.
“That’s fine, Baker. The second rather
needed pitchers last spring.”</p>

<p>“He’s going out for the first,” said Jimmy.
“Dud’s like me, you know. When Duty calls——”
Jimmy smiled eloquently.</p>

<p>“I say, though, Logan, who is this Johnnie you
spoke of? Mathews, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not Johnnie; Christopher,” replied Jimmy
gravely. “I referred to Mr. Christopher Mathewson,
better known as ‘Matty,’ the Dean of American
Pitchers. Dud and ‘Matty’ are as thick as
thieves; that is, Dud is! Dud reads everything
‘Matty’ writes and can tell you off-hand how many
games ‘Matty’ pitched last year and all the other
years, and how many he won, and what his averages
are and all the rest of it. He has a gallery of
Mathewson pictures and he’s the proud possessor
of a ball that Mathewson used in a game with
Philadelphia back in 1760 or thereabouts. I don’t
know how he got that ball, but I suspect that he
swiped it.”</p>

<p>“It was given to me,” said Dud defensively. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
he added, embarrassed: “You mustn’t mind what
Jimmy says. He talks a lot of nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I say, though,” exclaimed Hugh, “I do hope you
get on the first, Baker. It must be a lot of fun to
do the pitching, eh? More fun than fielding, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“Have you pitched much?” inquired Bert politely.</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to for a couple of years,” answered
Dud. “I don’t suppose I’ll make the first
this year, of course, but Murtha said he’d be glad
to have me try, and so——”</p>

<p>“You must make allowances for his modesty,”
said Jimmy. “He’s really rather a shark at it. He
can tell you just how to pitch any ball ever discovered,
from a straight one to a ‘floater.’”</p>

<p>“Question is, I guess,” Bert laughed, “whether
he can <em>pitch</em> ’em. I know <em>how</em> to pitch a ‘knuckle
ball,’ but I can’t do it. I remember now, Baker,
you pitched some on the second last year, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Only three games, or parts of them, Winslow.
I dare say I won’t be good enough this year, but—I
thought I’d try.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Bert heartily. “Nothing like
trying. The trouble is, though, you’ve got some
good ones to stack up against, eh? There’s Nate
Leddy and Ben Myatt——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“And Gus Weston,” observed Jimmy gravely.</p>

<p>Bert smiled. “Just the same, Gus has pitched
some good games for us. But isn’t he a wonder
when he goes up?”</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled. “Gus Weston can go up quicker
and higher than any fellow I ever saw,” he said.
“And when he <em>is</em> wild——” He ended with an impressive
whistle.</p>

<p>“He looked pretty promising last spring,” continued
Bert. “Remember the game he pitched
against Middleboro? They only got six hits off
him, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Kelly is another chap that is likely to
make good this year,” said Jimmy. “Oh, we’re
pretty well off for twirlers, but you wait until Dud
gets going. And speaking of going, Dud, what do
you say if we do a little of it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t rush off,” said Bert. “Well, come around
again, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Probably the invitation was meant to include Dud,
but Hugh thought that Dud might not interpret it
so and added cordially, “Yes, do, fellows!”</p>

<p>On the way downstairs Jimmy said: “Well, we
got out of that pretty well, Dud. I thought for
a while you were going to spoil everything by monopolizing
the conversation the way you did,
but——”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to know what to talk about,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Dud ruefully. “I guess Ordway thought me an
awful ass.”</p>

<p>“Well, he rather pointedly invited you to come
back, so I don’t think you need to worry about
that. The next time——”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any next time,” interrupted the
other. “It’s just like you said, Jimmy. I can’t mix
and there’s no use trying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is! We’ve just started. That
was the—the entering wedge, so to say. We’ll
drop around again next week. And between now
and then I’ll put you through a course of sprouts,
old chap. We’ll mix in society. Just as soon as
you can learn to forget your plaguey self, Dud,
you’ll get on finely. The trouble is with you that
you just sit and worry about what fellows are thinking
of you. But I’ll break you of that quick
enough.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll call it off,” muttered Dud.</p>

<p>“And I guess we won’t,” was the firm response.
“Having set my hand to the plow, Dudley, I never
look back. That’s me. My full name is Grim Determination.
All others are impostors. Accept no
substitutes. Guaranteed to comply with the Pure
Food Law. After you, Dud. One flight and turn
to the right, please.”</p>

<small>29 LOTHROP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">True to his promise—or threat, if you think
with Dud—Jimmy haled his protesting
friend from room to room in the evenings,
made him join the throngs on the ice or the toboggan
slide in the afternoons and on all occasions
dragged him into the conversations and, to
use his own expression, “got him in the spot-light.”
It can’t be truthfully said that his efforts met with
overwhelming success, however. Dud didn’t shine
as a conversationalist or display any traits calculated
to win popularity. No one disliked him in the
least. Most of the time few were really conscious
of his presence, in spite of Jimmy’s untiring efforts.
Personally, as has been suggested, Dud didn’t take
kindly to being exhibited and exploited, and when
a fortnight or so after the inception of the undertaking
Jimmy actually got to telling jokes and crediting
them to Dud, the latter was supremely uncomfortable.
Jimmy would chuckle and say: “Dud
got off a good one the other day, fellows.” And
then he would follow with some more or less brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
remark or joke that sounded to Dud horribly
flat. Generally the hearers laughed and shot surprised
glances at the silent and embarrassed Dud,
but he didn’t win recognition as a wit or a sage for
all of that. Had they heard the things from Dud
first-hand they might have been more impressed.
As it was the credit went rather to Jimmy than
Dud.</p>

<p>Jimmy played Boswell to Dud’s Doctor Johnson
with remarkable enthusiasm and patience. He
evolved all sorts of schemes, most of which his
chum promptly refused to consider, designed to
waft Dud into the white light of publicity. For instance,
he conceived the brilliant idea of having Dud
write a notable article for <cite>The Campus</cite>, the school
monthly. Dud had no serious objection to that
project, but it fell through because neither of them
could think of a subject to write on. Then Jimmy
suggested that Dud get someone to break through
the ice on the river so Dud could rescue him. Jimmy
said he would be glad to impersonate the drowning
character if he wasn’t afraid of catching cold and
having rheumatism in his throwing arm. It was
all highly entertaining for Jimmy and he thoroughly
enjoyed it, but Dud was getting very tired of it.
Every now and then Jimmy had what he called a
“show down.” At such times he would take a list
from his drawer in the study table and check off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the names of fellows whose acquaintance Dud had
succeeded in making since the last time.</p>

<p>“Churchill, we got him. Check for Churchill.
He was a brand new one, wasn’t he? Roy Dresser,
check. Dresser was rather a success, Dud. I think
he rather took to you. We must call there again.
I’ll make a note of that. Dresser’s room is a good
place to meet fellows. Parker, check. Parker’s an
ass, anyway. Ayer—I say, Dud, we haven’t met
Neil Ayer yet. Do you know him at all?”</p>

<p>“Only to speak to.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go after Ayer this evening, then. I know
where to find him. He will be in Joe Leslie’s room,
I guess. Foster Tray, check. Tray’s a good sort.
Zanetti—that’s another chap we’ve missed. We’ll
have to find him with Nate Leddy some time. I
don’t know him at all. He’s a good fellow to know,
though. Stands in with the football and the track
crowds. I tell you what, Dud! Why not go out
for the Track Team?”</p>

<p>“Because I can’t do anything,” laughed Dud.</p>

<p>“How do you know you can’t?” asked Jimmy,
untroubled. “Besides, you wouldn’t have to really
<em>do</em> anything. You could have a try at something
and you’d meet a lot of fellows. Jumping isn’t
awfully hard. Why not try the broad jump?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do that and pitch too, you idiot.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I forgot. Still, some fellows do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
go in for baseball and track. There’s Cherry, for
instance. Well, never mind. Maybe we’d better—er—concentrate.”
Jimmy sat back and studied
Dud speculatively, tapping his pen against his teeth
the while. “What we’ve got to do, Dud,” he continued
presently, in the tones of one who has reached
a weighty conclusion after much thought, “is to
put it all over those other box artists. That’s our
line, Dud. We’ve got to spring you as a startling
phenom! Yes, sir, that’s the game!”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough, Jimmy, but suppose I
can’t pitch a little bit when the time comes?”</p>

<p>“By Ginger, you’ve got to! Look here, you’re
wasting time. You ought to be at it every day.
You ought to get down in the cage in the gym and
practice. What time is it now? Nearly six, eh?
Too late today, then. But tomorrow we’ll put in
a half-hour, and the next day, too, and right along
until they call candidates. I’ll catch you. I’ll borrow
a mitt somewhere. It’ll be good fun, too.
Practice for both of us. Great scheme, eh?”</p>

<p>“Do you mind?” asked Dud eagerly.</p>

<p>“Love to! We’ve got a week yet and you ought
to be able to get a lot of practice in a week. That’s
settled, then. But we mustn’t forget the—er—the
social side of the campaign. So let’s see.” Jimmy
bent over his list again. “Quinn, check. Milford—had
him before. Forbes——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>The second visit to Hugh Ordway’s study came
off right on schedule, nine days after the first call,
but on this occasion Dud and Jimmy found the room
jammed from door to windows with fellows and a
loud and even violent argument going on. Their
appearance went practically unnoticed and they
found seats with some difficulty and became for
a while silent listeners. The argument proved to
be concerned with the election the evening before
of one Starling Meyer as captain of the Hockey
Team. The hockey team had just finished a disastrous
season, ending with a second defeat by
Grafton’s ancient rival, Mount Morris. Lack of
hard ice had aided in the team’s demoralization, but
besides that things had gone badly from start to
finish, and there were many who credited the afore-mentioned
Meyer with having been largely to
blame. “Pop” Driver, who played right guard on
the eleven and was normally good-natured to a fault,
expressed the views of the anti-Meyer faction.</p>

<p>“Meyer,” Pop was saying, “has caused more
trouble all the winter than he’s worth. Everything
that Yetter’s wanted to do one way, Star’s insisted
on doing another. You fellows know that, all of
you. Look at the way they changed the style of
play in the middle of the season. Yetter started
out playing four men on defense and it worked all
right. Then Star got to saying that we weren’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
scoring enough points and that the four-men-back
business was all wrong. He grouched and sulked
about it until Yetter gave in to him. After that
we got licked right along, with one or two exceptions,
and finally Yetter went back to the old style
again, and Star threatened to quit and there was
the dickens to pay for awhile. Star’s simply no use
unless he can be the whole shooting-match.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve made him captain,” said Jim
Quinn, football manager, “so now he can show what
he knows.”</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in blaming everything on Star
Meyer,” declared Ned Musgrave. “Yetter’s a
good chap, but he hadn’t any business being captain.
There’s where the whole trouble began. If
Yetter——”</p>

<p>“Warren would have been all right,” said Bert
Winslow, “if Star had let him alone. But Star
hates to see anyone else have any say about anything.
He’s a peach of a hockey player, I’ll grant
you that, but he’s a peach of a trouble-maker, too.
And I’ll bet you anything things will be in a worse
mess next year than they were this.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they elect Gus Weston?” asked Roy
Dresser. “Gus would have made a dandy leader.”</p>

<p>“Because Star pulled all the strings he could,”
answered Pop, “and scared the fellows into voting
for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“I happen to know, Pop,” interposed Musgrave
warmly, “that more than three-fourths of the team
wanted Star for captain long before election. You
might as well be fair to him, Pop. Give him a show.
Don’t convict a fellow before he’s tried, I say!”</p>

<p>“All right, Ned,” answered Pop good-naturedly.
“We’ll let him have his trial. Maybe you’re right,
too. Star may make a better captain than he did
a first lieutenant. Let’s hope so. I won’t be here
to see, though.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” inquired Nick Blake
maliciously, raising a laugh at Driver’s expense.
Pop, as he himself put it, was doing the four-year
course in five, and there was always some doubt
as to his getting through in five. Pop grinned now
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“They’ll give me my diploma to get rid of me,
Nick,” he said.</p>

<p>Jimmy, who had remained quiescent until now,
took advantage of a momentary lull in the discussion
and chuckled. Pop, beside him, turned inquiringly.
“What’s on your mind, Jimmy?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of something Dud got off
awhile ago,” replied Jimmy, still visibly amused.
Dud threw an entreating look at him, but Jimmy pretended
not to see it.</p>

<p>“Dud who?” asked Pop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“Dud Baker, over here.” Jimmy’s glance indicated
his friend. “We were talking about the
hockey team losing so many games one day and
Dud said he guessed the trouble with them”—Jimmy
had managed to gain the attention of
the room by now—“was that they were weak from
Star-vation!”</p>

<p>Dud looked anything but like the author of the
bonmot at that moment, but the audience laughed,
even Ned Musgrave, and Jimmy credited himself
with a bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>“The pun,” observed Nick Blake gravely, “is
considered the lowest form of humor.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s mighty clever,” exclaimed Hugh.
“You’re hipped because you didn’t think of it yourself,
Nick.”</p>

<p>“Dry up, ’Ighness! I was about to say when you
so rudely interrupted that it is, of course, necessary
to consider one’s audience, and that, having the
mentality of the audience in mind, Baker’s joke may
be considered clever, even brilliant. For my
part——”</p>

<p>“Choke him, somebody,” said Bert. “After all,
say what you like about Star, you’ve got to acknowledge
that there’s much to ad-Meyer about——”</p>

<p>But Nick’s groan of anguish drowned the rest,
and Dresser, pretending disgust, arose to depart,
setting the example for several others. Jimmy, fearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
that Dud’s gloomy silence might undo the effect
created by the joke, thought the moment a good
one for retiring and led his chum away. Outside,
Dud remonstrated again.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t, Jimmy,” he said. “I feel
such an awful fool when you spring those jokes
and tell fellows I made ’em. They must know I
didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Why? You do say things as good as that, don’t
you? When there’s no one but me around, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe. I didn’t think that was
awfully funny, anyway, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled. “I do. And the others did.
Cheer up, Dud. I’ll make a celebrity of you in
spite of yourself!”</p>

<p>Later, back in Number 29 Lothrop, Bert Winslow
laughed suddenly while he was getting ready
for bed and Hugh, hearing, called across from his
own bedroom.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke, Bert?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of the one Jimmy Logan sprung;
about the hockey team being weak from Star-vation.
It isn’t so bad, eh?”</p>

<p>“Rather clever, but it was that chap Baker who
said it, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. But look here,” continued Bert, appearing
in his doorway in the course of a struggle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
with his collar, “why is it Baker never gets off any
of those things himself? It’s always Jimmy Logan
who springs ’em. All Baker does is to sit and look
glum. If he’s so all-fired clever why doesn’t he say
something once in a while? I think he’s a bit of
a pill.”</p>

<p>“He’s not so bad, I fancy,” replied Hugh.
“Maybe you have to know him. Some chaps are
like that, if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but——” Bert’s voice died out until he had
at last wrenched the refractory collar from his
neck. Then: “Here’s another funny thing, Hugh,”
he said. “Jimmy lugs that fellow around every
place with him; sort of butts in with him everywhere.
You’d think Jimmy was a—a nurse-maid
or something. Looks to me as if he was trying to
introduce his young friend into Society. I wouldn’t
care a bit if he forgot to bring him up here the
next time.”</p>

<p>“What have you got against him?” inquired
Hugh.</p>

<p>“Nothing much. He’s only a lower middler,
though, and lower middlers ought to keep to their
own set. Besides, look at the cheek of the kid!
Going to try for pitcher on the first! What do
you know about that?”</p>

<p>“But if he’s really any good at it,” began the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“How could he be? He can’t be more than fifteen,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“You were young once yourself, old chap.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I didn’t try to pitch on the first team,”
grumbled Bert. “He’s too fresh.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you just what’s the matter with him,”
said Hugh, appearing in the study in a suit of pink-striped
pajamas. “He’s shy, Bert.”</p>

<p>“Shy! And going out for the first nine!”</p>

<p>“I know it doesn’t look so,” laughed Hugh, “but
that’s just what his trouble is, and I rather fancy
that Logan, out of pure kindness, is trying to bring
him out, if you know what——”</p>

<p>“Pure kindness!” scoffed Bert. “Jimmy’s kind
enough, I guess, but if that’s his game you can bet
all you’ve got that he’s doing it for a lark. I know
Jimmy!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>A CHANCE MEETING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two days after the visit to Hugh Ordway’s
room Jimmy Logan’s joke which he had
attributed to Dud bore unexpected fruit.
The remark had tickled the fellows who had heard
it and consequently they very promptly repeated it,
with the natural result that within twenty-four hours
it got around to Starling Meyer himself. Star, as
he was generally called, was a large, good-looking
boy of seventeen, well supplied with self-conceit.
He was a rattling good hockey player, undoubtedly
the best in school, and a fair performer with the
second nine in the outfield. There his athletic
prowess ended, for he considered—or pretended to
consider—track sports unimportant and football unscientific.
He was a clever student and stood high
in class, and was, in consequence, rather a favorite
with the faculty. As a member of the Forum Society
his activities were critical rather than constructive,
for he took no part in the debates beyond attending
them and pointing out the deficiencies of the
debaters in a superior manner. Most fellows liked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
him, especially those who were not clever in the
lines he affected, and even those who saw through
his poses and couldn’t stand his conceit accorded
him honor for his brilliancy in class-room and on
the ice. Although Star roomed next door to Dud,
the latter knew him only as he knew three-fourths
of the students, that is, to nod to on passing. Once
or twice, since they had both been rather unimportant
members of the second baseball team last
year, they had spoken. But beyond that they were
strangers, and so when, two days after that visit
to 29 Lothrop, Star Meyer stopped Dud in front
of Trow by the simple but effective method of seizing
him by the arm, Dud was somewhat surprised.
Star was scowling and Dud didn’t need more than
one glance at his face to realize that he was angry.
Even when angry, however, Star didn’t allow himself
to forget his pose of contemptuous superiority,
and now when he spoke he managed a one-sided
smile designed to remind Dud of the honor being
done him.</p>

<p>“Baker, you’re a remarkably fresh young kid,”
began Star, “and some day that mouth of yours
is going to get you into a heap of trouble. Ever
think of that?”</p>

<p>Dud, puzzled, moved restively in the bigger boy’s
grasp but failed to get free. “I don’t know what
you mean, Meyer,” he protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you do. What’s the good of lying? After
this you leave my name out of your funny jokes;
hear?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what——” began Dud again.
Then recollection of Jimmy’s bon-mot came to him
and he flushed.</p>

<p>“The next time I’ll kick you from here to the
river,” said Star in a quietly venomous tone. “I’d
do it now for a couple of buttons, too. You leave
my name strictly alone, Baker, after this. Understand
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but honest, Meyer, I didn’t say——”
Then, however, Dud had to stop, for, although innocent,
to insist on the fact would put the blame
on Jimmy. He dropped his eyes. “All right,” he
muttered.</p>

<p>Somehow that phrase seemed to add fresh fuel
to Star’s smoldering anger, for he took a fresh
and very painful grip on Dud’s arm and said: “All
right, is it? Well, it isn’t all right, kid! <a href="#i_fp038">You’re
a sneaky little bounder, that’s what you are!</a> Saying
smart-aleck things and then trying to lie out
of it! Don’t you ever mention my name again. If
you do I’ll get you and you won’t forget it in a
hurry. Now you beat it!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp038">
  <img src="images/i_fp038.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_38">“‘You’re a sneaky little bounder, that’s what you are!’”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With a sudden wrench at the captive arm, Star
spun Dud around and aimed a kick at him. Fortunately,
a premonition of what was happening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
caused Dud to jump aside and Star’s foot missed
its goal. Dud, angry himself now, turned with
clenched fists and flashing eyes. But the situation
was distinctly hopeless. Star topped him by a head
and Dud was suddenly conscious of his own physical
inferiority. Still he might have tried conclusions
had it not been for the smile of haughty contempt
on the other’s countenance. Somehow that smile
was too much. It seemed to say: “What, you dare
to show disrespect to <em>me</em>? Begone, impious mortal!”
Dud’s fingers straightened again, he gulped
down his resentment, stole a doubtful glance at a
group of fellows who were looking on curiously from
the dormitory steps and walked away, trying his best
to appear dignified and unconcerned but secretly
feeling like a whipped cur. Later, when he recounted
the episode to Jimmy the latter took him
to task vigorously.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell him you didn’t say it? I’m
not afraid of the big fraud!”</p>

<p>“Considering you’d told everyone that I had said
it——”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so.” Jimmy frowned mightily.
“Well, then, why didn’t you light into him? Don’t
you see that the fellows who were watching you
will think you were afraid of him?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to, but—but somehow he looked so—so
sort of <em>superior</em>——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“Yah! That’s Star’s best bluff! Bet you anything
if you’d hit him just one little tap on the nose
he’d have run! Hang it, Dud, you’ve got to play
up, boy! Here I am making you out a regular
feller, and the first chance you get to—to put yourself
in the lime-light you fall down! Why, you had
the finest sort of an opportunity to distinguish yourself!
Think what it would have meant to you,
Dud! Fellows would have said: ‘What do you
know about young Baker licking Star Meyer
right in front of Trow this morning? Had it all
over him, they say! Beat him something brutal!
Some class to that kid, eh?’ That’s the way
they’d have talked you up. Now you’ve gone
and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass,” begged Dud with spirit.
“You know plaguey well I couldn’t lick Star. He’s
six inches taller than I am, and he’s at least seventeen
years old, and he’s—he’s stronger——”</p>

<p>“Son, when you get in a row with another chap,”
replied Jimmy emphatically, “don’t you stop to figure
out how much bigger or stronger he is. You
jump in and get the first lick at him. You’ll be
surprised to find what a lot of inches that first whack
takes off the other chap! What you should have
done——”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t,” said Dud shortly. “You
wouldn’t have, either, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Jimmy grinned. “Never mind what I’d have
done, Dud. I’m not making a name for myself.
I’m not——”</p>

<p>“Neither am I. You are. And I’m getting sick
of it. It’s no use, anyway. Let’s drop it.”</p>

<p>“Drop nothing,” replied Jimmy vigorously.
“We’re getting on famously. Why——”</p>

<p>“You’ve just said I’ve queered myself!”</p>

<p>“I said you’d missed a chance to make a hit. So
you have. But we can fix that all right. Those
fellows who saw it will talk, I guess, but we can
talk too. Who were they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Stiles was one, though.”</p>

<p>“The sweetest little gossip in school,” commented
Jimmy. “All right, Dud, you leave it to me. Your
Uncle James will fix it all hunky for you. You sit
tight and—yes, that’s the game! Dud, you must
go around looking very dignified for a couple of
days.”</p>

<p>“Rot!”</p>

<p>“I mean it. You must make fellows think that
you resisted a great temptation and that it has—er—has
sobered you. Get me?”</p>

<p>“What temptation?” asked Dud, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, the temptation to lose your temper and
beat Star up, of course,” explained Jimmy patiently.
“That’s our line, don’t you see? It was only by—by
superhuman control that you manfully resisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the impulse to fell him to the ground! Great stuff,
what? You just wait till I tell it!”</p>

<p>“Jimmy, for the love of lemons don’t start anything
else! Every time you get to talking you put
me in a hole. You’ve got fellows thinking I’m a
wit, and they all look at me in a funny sort of a
way as if they were waiting for me to spring something
bright, and I get tongue-tied and can’t think
of a thing to say. And you’re telling it around that
I’m going to be a wonderful pitcher, too. They
don’t believe that, of course, but it makes me look
silly. And now you want to make me out a—a
scrapper——”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all! Star resented your remark
about him and spoke insultingly to you. You
gave him a beautiful calling down and he didn’t
dare talk back. Then, when your back was turned,
he tried to kick you, and you, stifling your—er—your
natural and excusable indignation, kept your
temper wonderfully and walked superbly away. All
through the encounter your dignity was sublime!”</p>

<p>Dud groaned. “You’ll simply make me out an
awful ass and fellows will laugh at you—and me.
I wish you wouldn’t, Jimmy!”</p>

<p>“That remark merely shows how little you appreciate
my powers of diplomacy,” replied the other
in tones of sorrowful resignation. “But never
mind. I shall continue to do my best for you, Dud,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
even though my efforts are unappreciated, misunderstood.
Leave it all to me, my young friend.
Appear very dignified and—and aloof. Let’s see
you look aloof, Dud.”</p>

<p>Dud only looked disgusted.</p>

<p>“Not a bit like it,” resumed the other cheerfully.
“More like this. Get it? Sort of hinting at a
secret sorrow or—no, that’s not exactly the idea,
either. You want to look like the hero in the second
act of the play, when everyone thinks he stole the
jewels and the heroine spurns him. He knows that
he’s innocent, you see, and knows that the audience
will know it in the last act. So he just looks disdainful
and a bit sad and sort of moons around by
himself and smokes a good deal to salve his sorrow——”</p>

<p>“I can’t smoke,” interrupted Dud practically.
“They won’t let me, and I don’t like it anyway.”</p>

<p>Jimmy waved his hand airily. “You get the idea,
though, Dud. ‘Too proud to fight’ is your line, old
chap. Now shut up and let me think.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s thinking resulted in action. That afternoon
about four he might have been observed lingering
idly in front of School Hall, hands in pockets,
whistling tunelessly, evidently quite at a loose end.
Nick Blake tried to entice him up to Lit to play
pool, Gus Weston suggested the joys of a trip to
the village for hot soda and Pete Gordon strove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
to lure him to his room. Jimmy resisted heroically
and was left to his devices. It was a particularly
disagreeable afternoon, with a hard wind freezing
the pools along the walk, and Jimmy from time to
time glanced impatiently at the big doors behind him.
But it was nearly the half-hour before they finally
opened again to emit Ned Stiles. Warned by the
creaking of the portal, Jimmy instantly assumed the
appearance of one who, passing, has his attention
attracted by the sound of an opening door. This
in the face of the fact that he had been all along
aware that Stiles, in trouble with Mr. Gibbs, the
history instructor, had been having an after-school
séance with “Gusty” in a classroom. Stiles was an
upper middler, seventeen years old, an uninteresting
and rather sycophantic youth whom Jimmy secretly
disliked very much. Stiles suspected the fact and
was consequently somewhat surprised when Jimmy,
after nodding briefly, halted and awaited him at the
foot of the steps.</p>

<p>“Hello, Stiles. Rotten day, isn’t it? Seen Guy
Murtha lately?”</p>

<p>Stiles shook his head, changing his books from
one elbow to the other in order to reach his handkerchief
and blow a very red nose. Stiles always
had a cold in winter and snuffled from October to
April.</p>

<p>“Can’t find him anywhere,” continued Jimmy in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
preoccupied tones, accommodating his steps to those
of the other boy and continuing on toward Trow.
“Star Meyer said he thought he’d gone to the village.
I want to see him awfully.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him all day, I guess,” said Stiles.
He was hoping that some of the fellows would look
from their windows and see him hob-nobbing with
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I can get him at supper,” said the
latter. Then he chuckled, and, in response to Stiles’
unspoken question, explained, “I was thinking of
Star. He hasn’t got over it yet, I guess. Grumpy
as anything he was.”</p>

<p>“Got over what?” asked Stiles eagerly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear about it?” Jimmy looked at
him incredulously. “Why, Dud Baker gave him an
awful calling down this morning and Star took
it like a lamb. Say, that kid certainly has got
spunk!”</p>

<p>Stiles viewed the other suspiciously, but Jimmy’s
countenance expressed truth and quiet amusement.
Stiles grunted. Then he said “Huh!” doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Star was mad as a hornet about something Dud
said; some joke or other, you know.”</p>

<p>Stiles nodded. “Yes, about the hockey team dying
of Star-vation.”</p>

<p>“Was that it? Well, anyway, he got after Dud
and wanted Dud to apologize and Dud told him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
chase himself, that it was all true and that every
fellow in school knew it, and a lot more. And Star
was mad enough to bite! Think of Dud getting
away with it!”</p>

<p>“I saw it,” said Stiles, “but it didn’t look—just
like that to me. Star had Baker by the arm and it
looked like he was reading the riot act to him. And
then he tried to kick him and Baker beat it.”</p>

<p>“Good thing for Star he did, then,” said Jimmy
knowingly. “I’d hate to stand up to Dud Baker
when he was riled!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know he was—that sort,” said Stiles interestedly.
They had reached the entrance to Trow
and paused at the door.</p>

<p>“Dud Baker? Didn’t you ever hear why he left
the school he was at before he came here?”</p>

<p>Stiles shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t a nice story to tell, although it
wasn’t all Dud’s fault. I heard it from a fellow
who was there and saw it. In fact, he helped to
carry the other fellow to his room. He was three
years older than Dud and a whole head taller, too,
they say. But Dud isn’t the sort of fellow you can
bully. Or he wasn’t. Nowadays Dud will stand a
lot. I guess after that fracas he learned to keep
his temper. The other fellow was in bed a month.
It was such a close shave for him that it sort of
sobered Dud up and he will go most any length<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
now to keep from scrapping. He’s got an awful
punch, they say.”</p>

<p>Stiles looked vastly amazed, but Jimmy, glancing
from the corners of his eyes, saw to his satisfaction
that there was no incredulity in the amazement.
Stiles had swallowed the yarn whole and
was gasping for more. But Jimmy knew the value
of silence.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll run over to Lothrop. If you
should see Guy you might tell him I’m looking for
him. So long.”</p>

<p>“But, look here, Logan,” called Stiles eagerly;
“what was it Baker said to Star, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know just what he told him, but it
was aplenty. And Star took it, too!”</p>

<p>“But he—he kicked Baker! We saw him!”</p>

<p>“Never!” replied Jimmy vehemently. “He may
have kicked <em>at</em> him. In fact, some fellow told me
he did aim a kick at Dud when Dud’s back was
turned. Said Dud turned like a tiger on him then
and he thought sure it was all up with Star. But
Dud controlled himself and walked quietly away.
Gee, I couldn’t have done that, Stiles! It must
have been great to see, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—yes, only——” Stiles paused. “It
looked to us as if Baker was scared, Logan. Of
course he wasn’t, but that’s what it looked like. I
didn’t know he was such a scrapper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“Who, Dud?” Jimmy spread his hands expressively.
“Take my advice, old man, and don’t
let him hear you say he looked scared, though
maybe he wouldn’t touch you. And then again he
might lose control of that temper of his and——
Better not risk it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think of it,” said Stiles earnestly. “I
didn’t really think he was scared, you know; only
some of the other fellows who saw it said it <em>looked</em>
that way. Don’t tell Dud Baker I said that, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Me? No indeed. In fact, I wouldn’t mention
the thing to him at any price. He’s awfully
touchy, you see, and ever since this morning he’s
been sort of like a bear with a sore head. I guess
there’s times when he wishes he’d forgotten himself
and let fly! Well, so long!”</p>

<p>Jimmy walked on toward Lothrop and Ned
Stiles plunged through the door and hurried down
the corridor to leave his books and then spread his
news to all who would hearken to it. And Jimmy,
approaching the first entrance to Lothrop Hall,
winked gravely at the ornamental brass knocker.</p>

<small>DUD LOSES HIS TEMPER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Winter,” observed Jimmy very disgustedly
one morning toward the last of February,
“is sure ‘lingering in the lap of
spring,’ as the poet hath it. Between you and
me, Dud, I guess winter’s fallen asleep there!
Here it is almost March and everything’s still
covered up with snow or ice. Or water,” he
added a second later, his gaze falling to the pools
of melting snow that lay in the hollows of the
campus.</p>

<p>The windows were wide open and the air that
came in, while chill and damp, still, somehow, held
a suggestion—or perhaps a faint promise—of
spring. But the sky was leaden, between the walks
the sod was hidden under patches of dirty snow
or ice that had begun to melt a little and the whole
morning world had a tired and bedraggled look.
Jimmy, still attired in pajamas, shivered and turned
disapprovingly away. Then his gaze fell on Dud
and the disapproval increased, for Dud, half awake
a moment before, had nestled down on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
rumpled pillow again and was sleeping peacefully.
Jimmy was righteously indignant.</p>

<p>“Wake up, you sluggard!” he bawled, pulling the
clothes from the other. “Here I’ve been talking
to you for five minutes, saying perfectly gorgeous
things, and you haven’t heard a word! Get up,
you lazy loafer, and hear the birdies sing—or
sneeze! Come out of there!”</p>

<p>Dud came out, rather in a heap, blinking confusedly,
and strove to pull the clothes from the bed
to his shrinking form on the floor. But Jimmy was
merciless, and Dud was forced to arise grumblingly
and rub his sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>“Wh—what time is it?” he yawned.</p>

<p>“Never mind what time it is,” replied Jimmy severely.
“It’s time you were up and doing——”</p>

<p>“‘With a heart for any fate,’” murmured Dud
poetically if sleepily. “What day is it?”</p>

<p>“Great Jumpin’ Jehosophat!” exclaimed Jimmy.
“He doesn’t even know the date! It’s a Tuesday,
darling, and the month’s February, and the year——”</p>

<p>“Then it’s today practice begins,” said Dud. “I
knew there was something.” He arose and sought
his bath robe. “I’ll bet it’s awfully early. I don’t
hear anyone up.”</p>

<p>“You hear me up,” responded his roommate.
“As a matter of fact, I don’t know just what time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
it is, because you forgot to wind the clock and my
watch has stopped and I couldn’t find yours. But
it must be long after six——”</p>

<p>“Six!” grunted Dud in deep disgust. “What do
you go pulling me out of bed at six for? I’m going
back again!”</p>

<p>“I said it was long after six. Where’s your
watch? Have a look at it.”</p>

<p>Dud discovered that article at last dangling over
the back of a chair, it having escaped from a pocket,
and in more mollified tones informed Jimmy that
it was twenty to seven. In the corridor a door
opened and slippered feet pattered toward the bathroom.
Jimmy set his watch and the clock, found
his own robe and then, pausing at the door, asked
solicitously:</p>

<p>“How’s the old arm, Dud?”</p>

<p>“Sore,” was the answer. Dud bent it and flexed
it—it was his right one—and observed it scowlingly.
“It’s lame all the way to the shoulder. <em>Ouch!</em> And
the shoulder’s lame, too!”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Jimmy. “I was afraid you
might overdo it, Dud.”</p>

<p>“Well, whose silly idea was it, anyway?” demanded
Dud indignantly. “Who suggested practicing
every day, I’d just like to know?”</p>

<p>“I did, of course, but I didn’t tell you to do too
much of it and lame yourself, did I? What you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
gone and done, Dud, is catch cold in it. You ought
to be mighty careful that way. You ought——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” grumbled Dud. “You make me
tired. If you know so pesky much about it, why
didn’t you say something before? I wouldn’t have
caught cold in it if you hadn’t insisted on slopping
around in that rink yesterday with the water up to
your ankles! No wonder I caught cold!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to lay off a few days, old chap.
It’ll be all right again, I guess.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine, isn’t it, when I’ve got to report for
practice this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to pitch, though,” responded
Jimmy consolingly. “Just do the setting-up stuff.
Come on and get your bath.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any bath,” muttered Dud, still feeling
of his pitching arm with cautious fingers. “You
go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Dud,” said the other severely, “you’ve got a
grouch. You must have got out of bed the wrong
way.”</p>

<p>“I did, when you pulled me out,” was the pointed
reply. “And who wouldn’t have a grouch, I’d like
to know? I’ll have a fat chance to do any pitching,
won’t I?”</p>

<p>“You can tell ’em you lamed yourself, can’t you?
Cheer up, Dud, and come ahead before the crowd
gathers. I’ll rub it for you when we get back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Huh! I guess that’s what’s the matter with it
now. You nearly killed me last night with your old
massaging, as you called it.”</p>

<p>“It may hurt a little,” said Jimmy earnestly, “but
it’s awfully good for you. It’s regular Swedish stuff,
Dud. I learned it from a chap at home who works
in the gym. We ought to have some liniment,
though. I wonder if that liquid dentifrice stuff of
yours would do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my own rubbing, thanks,” replied the
other ungraciously. “If it hadn’t been for you——”</p>

<p>“Help!” wailed Jimmy, hurrying through the
door. Then came the sound of quick scurrying in
the corridor, and Dud, still mooning on the side of
the bed, guessed that Jimmy and some other chap
were racing for a bathtub. Dud hoped the other
fellow would win. He continued to explore the
lamed muscles of his arm for several minutes, finding
a grim satisfaction in the twinges of pain he
evoked. Finally, however, he slung the cords of
his bath-robe together and dejectedly followed the
others down the corridor. As luck would have it,
three other youths were awaiting their turns at the
tubs, while Starling Meyer reached the washroom
at the same moment Dud did. Star fixed a haughty
and scornful glare on the younger boy.</p>

<p>“I’m ahead of you,” he announced briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Most any other time Dud would have acquiesced
without a murmur, but this morning his peevishness
made him combative and courageous. “Like fun
you are,” he replied scowlingly.</p>

<p>A perceptible thrill went through the other members
of the waiting group. Dud Baker and Star
Meyer were going to have a scrap! They had heard
of Dud’s fighting reputation, and now they were to
witness an example of that youth’s quality! They
almost held their breaths in the excitement, their
round eyes traveling from Star to Dud and back
again expectantly. Star frowned portentously.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” he remarked coldly.</p>

<p>“You bet we’ll see,” agreed Dud, a strange recklessness
taking possession of him. Somehow this
morning Star didn’t look nearly so formidable, perhaps
because his eyes were still heavy with sleep or
because the flaming red bath-robe in which he was
enveloped was so palpable an affront to good taste.
Star stared an instant in perplexed surprise and then
deliberately turned his gaze away from Dud’s pugnacious
countenance, indicating contempt and scorn
and several other things that riled Dud still further.
From the cubicles holding the tubs came the rush
and splash of water and the voices of the bathers.
No healthy boy ever bathed silently, and the four
in the tubs were, judging from the sounds, remarkably
robust! Jimmy was chanting a football pæan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
at the top of his lungs, another boy was singing
something remarkably tuneless and repetitional and
the other two were exchanging badinage across the
partition at the tops of their voices.</p>

<p>After a moment one of the doors opened, a very
pink-hued youth emerged and it was the turn of one
of the interested trio. Oddly enough the latter
showed a strange disinclination to avail himself of
his prerogative. Instead he offered in a whisper
to let one of the others precede him. But the reply
was a shake of the head, the boy not even removing
his fascinated gaze from Dud.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to go then, and the
youth went, disappearing behind the door most reluctantly.
Star moved impatiently from one foot
to the other. “You fellows in there, get a move
on,” he advised loudly. “We’ve been waiting here
ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Keep on waiting, old chap,” replied Jimmy, interrupting
his song. “Don’t know who you are,
but you’re an awful fibber. I say, Dud, are you
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” growled Dud.</p>

<p>“Hand me a piece of soap from the stand, will
you?”</p>

<p>Dud wanted to say no, but thought better of it
and ungraciously crossed the washroom and secured
a cake of soap. “Catch,” he called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Stop it!” squealed Jimmy. “Don’t chuck! Here,
pass it in.” The door opened a bit and Jimmy’s
face appeared in the slit. “Squeeze in,” he whispered.
“I’m through.”</p>

<p>Dud thrust the door open and entered, and
Jimmy quickly bolted it again. “Who’s out there?”
he whispered. But before Dud could inform him
Star Meyer’s voice was raised in indignant protest.</p>

<p>“You can’t do that, Logan! It isn’t Baker’s turn.
There are three of us ahead of him. You come out
of there, Baker!”</p>

<p>“I only took half a bath, Star,” replied Jimmy
amiably. “I’m letting Dud have the other half.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are! No funny business now! Here,
Benson, it’s your turn. Go ahead in. They can’t
do that.”</p>

<p>Benson, a slim, unaggressive youth, stared at Star
in alarm. “I—I’m in no hurry, thanks, Meyer.
I—I’d just as lief wait, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Then you, whatever your name is, it’s your
tub!”</p>

<p>The second boy shook his head and grinned. “I
don’t like that one,” he replied diplomatically. “The
plug leaks. I’ll wait.”</p>

<p>Star scowled and looked doubtfully at the closed
door. For some reason intense quiet prevailed.
Not a splash was heard. “Then if you fellows won’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
take it,” he said resolutely, “it’s my turn. That’s
my tub, Baker. You’d better come out of there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be out when I’ve had my bath,” was the
truculent reply, followed by a sound very much like
that caused by a hand descending approvingly on a
bare shoulder. Star strode across and rattled the
door, but the only response was the gurgling of
water as the plug was withdrawn.</p>

<p>“I’ll report you to Mr. Gibbs,” announced Star
loftily. “You’re supposed to take your turn. You’d
better let me in there.”</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and Jimmy came out.
Star drew back a step and Dud quickly shot the bolt
again. Jimmy smiled sweetly and carelessly at Star.
“Don’t be a grouch, old man,” he said. “There’s
lots of water yet.”</p>

<p>Star fell back on his haughty attitude and observed
Jimmy as from Olympian heights. Jimmy
chuckled. “Great stuff, Star,” he approved. Then
he nodded affably to the round-eyed Benson and
took himself gracefully from sight. At that moment
another cubicle emptied itself of its occupant and
Star, swallowing his wrath, absent-mindedly entered
it, leaving the two waiting youths to scowl blankly
at the closed door. After a moment Benson ejaculated
in a careful whisper: “<em>Hog!</em>” The other
boy nodded agreement. “I thought he and Baker
were going to scrap,” he confided sotto voce. “Gee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
I wish they had. And I wish Baker had done him
up! He’s just a big bluff, that’s what he is!” From
the further cubicle came the sound of song. Dud
was regaining his temper.</p>

<small>FIRST PRACTICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was a large attendance at half-past
three that afternoon in the baseball cage.
Some forty-odd candidates, most of them
last year’s first and second team members, had assembled
for work, while fully as many others were
on hand to watch proceedings. Not that anything
very exciting promised, but it was a raw, uncomfortable
sort of day outside and fellows were glad
of any event that offered a half hour’s mild amusement.
The cage was not a very ambitious affair,
for it had been an after-thought and had been built
after the building was erected and at a sacrifice of
one of the two bowling alleys, which, thrown into
the space formerly occupied by a storeroom, supplied
area for a modest cage. It was large enough
to throw at base distance in and to hold batting
practice in if the batter didn’t attempt anything
more than a tap. Also, of course, it made an excellent
place for the pitchers to limber up.</p>

<p>Dud and Jimmy went over to the gymnasium together,
for the latter had finally decided to try his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
luck with the first nine. When, having got into his
gymnasium suit, Dud looked around for Jimmy, he
was rather disconcerted to find himself confronting
Starling Meyer across the bench. Dud didn’t feel
so brave today, and would have been just as satisfied
if he hadn’t run across the hockey star. But
the latter only glared in a haughtily disgusted manner
and turned his back, and Dud heaved a sigh of
relief, not loud but fervent, and made his way unobtrusively
out of the locker-room. He was careful
to nod or speak to such fellows as he knew, although
lots of times it took a good deal of courage. He
was obeying Jimmy’s directions, however.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait for fellows to speak to you,” Jimmy
had ordered. “Speak first. Don’t act as if you
were afraid they wouldn’t know you, either. Just
say, ‘Hello, Smith,’ sort of careless-like, or, if you
don’t know them fairly well, just nod and smile.
Don’t grin, smile. Like this.” And Jimmy turned
the corners of his mouth up slightly and nodded his
head very briefly. “Get the idea! ‘I know who
you are, but I don’t recall the name.’ But don’t try
that on the big fellows like—well, like Murtha and
Trafford and those chaps. You want to be polite
to them, sort of cordial, too. Only don’t let them
think you’re trying to swipe.”</p>

<p>“Which I am,” Dud had interpolated a trifle bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“Not at all! You’re merely being—er—tactful.
There’s a difference. Tact and diplomacy are great
things, Dud. You want to practice ’em.”</p>

<p>“Toadying, I call it!”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! Nothing like it. Call it—call it a
studied effort to please!”</p>

<p>“Call it what you like,” Dud had replied somberly.
“It’s poor business.”</p>

<p>“Some of our greatest citizens have been diplomats,
Dud. Look at me!”</p>

<p>Dud’s gaze picked out a number of baseball
celebrities whom, under Jimmy’s tutelage, he had
come to know well enough to speak to. In every
case, if he found himself near enough to speak
he spoke, or, failing that, he nodded, trying to look
quite at his ease and not succeeding very well. Guy
Murtha was there, of course, for Guy was this
year’s captain. He was eighteen, a tall, decidedly
plain youth with so many likable qualities that one
soon forgot about his features. And Bert Winslow
and Nick Blake were talking together further on,
and near by were Ben Myatt and Pete Gordon and
Nate Leddy. And Hugh Ordway was one of a
group the rest of whom Dud knew only by sight.
Jimmy appeared from somewhere and about that
moment Mr. Sargent, the physical director and
baseball coach, came in with Tris Barnes, the manager.
Mr. Sargent, or “Pete,” as he was called, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
short and square, with a beard and mustache and
a pair of restless brown eyes behind the big round
lenses of his spectacles. He had a nervous, impatient
manner of speaking and was quite likely, to
the secret amusement and delight of the fellows,
to get his words twisted when the least bit excited.</p>

<p>“All out of the cage, please, but team candidates,”
was his order. “Close that door, somebody. Better
bolt it, Churchill. Now, fellows, if you’ll kindly
top stalking—ah—stop talking, we’ll get started.
Captain Murtha, want to say anything?”</p>

<p>“I guess not, sir. There’ll be plenty of time to
talk later on, won’t there? I’d like to say, though,
that we’re going to need more candidates than are
here today and I wish you fellows would try and
get others to come out. There’s no use waiting
until we get outdoors, for this work in the cage
is very important and fellows who miss it won’t
stand much show. Our season begins pretty early
this spring, a week earlier than last year, and we
haven’t any too much time to get in shape. I’d
like mighty well to see fully twenty more fellows
here tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; this is a very poor showing,” agreed
Mr. Sargent. “Well, we’ll make a start, fellows.
We’re going to have setting-up work this afternoon
and for a few days. How’s that, Barnes?
No, no dumb-bells today, thanks. Just get in line,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
fellows, will you? About four rows will do. That’s
it. Now then, follow me, please. And keep your
mind on what you’re doing. One, two, three, four!
Stretch the arms out as far as they’ll go. All right.
Now the wrists; twist! One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight—keep it up! All right!”</p>

<p>It soon became tiresome to Dud, for he hadn’t
been in training and the gymnasium work twice
weekly had not been strenuous. It was, he reflected,
rather remarkable to find so many muscles
that creaked in unsuspected places! Almost in front
of him, in the second row, Star Meyer was going
through the evolutions easily and gracefully and
untiringly, and with something of his usual haughty
disdain for anything not of his own devising. In
gymnasium shirt and trunks Star showed strong
and muscular, and Dud felt a warm satisfaction
over the fact that he and Star had not come to blows
that morning in the bathroom! Star’s legs were
things to admire as the muscles played over them
like whip-cords and Dud wished that he had paid
a little more attention to his physical condition during
the past year or two. He imagined that his
own thin, elongated body must look strangely out
of place there with all those other well-conditioned
ones. Further along, where he could just be seen
out of the corners of Dud’s eyes, stood Jimmy,
sturdy and stocky, loafing a bit when Mr. Sargent’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
gaze was not on him. Dud wanted to loaf, too,
but didn’t dare.</p>

<p>The calisthenics lasted less than a half-hour, by
which time Dud was not the only one breathing
hard and perspiring freely, and then Barnes set
the candidates’ names down. When it was Dud’s
turn to register Star Meyer was nearly at his elbow,
a fact which added to Dud’s embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Name?” asked the manager.</p>

<p>“Dudley Baker, Upper Middle.”</p>

<p>“Age, Baker?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Experience?”</p>

<p>“I was on the second nine last year.”</p>

<p>“Position?”</p>

<p>“P-pitcher, please.”</p>

<p>Someone sniggered. It wasn’t Star, for Star
never sniggered. It was too low and common.
Star only looked insultingly amused. Barnes looked
a little amused, too, although he tried not to.</p>

<p>“All right, Baker. Get on the scales and let
me know your weight tomorrow. Don’t forget,
please.”</p>

<p>Dud, aware of more than one amused countenance,
moved away and sought the locker-room, conscious
that his cheeks were very red. Jimmy, already
out of his gymnasium togs, noticed and
frowned disapprovingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“Why the blushes, Dud?” he asked severely.</p>

<p>Dud muttered something evasive and passed on
to his locker. But later Jimmy wormed it out of
him. Jimmy always could. And Jimmy frowned
once more. “We’ll have to do something with
Star,” he said thoughtfully, “something to make him
have a little more respect for his betters. I wonder——”</p>

<p>Dud laughed. “I thought wondering was my
stunt, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“So it is. I don’t wonder, then. I—I merely
speculate. Look here, Dud, know what I think?”
Dud shook his head hopelessly. “Well, then,”
Jimmy went on, “I think you’d better have a show-down
with Star.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a—a show-down?” faltered Dud.</p>

<p>“I mean pick a quarrel with him and fight him.
You see, Star has a good deal of influence, and I’m
afraid he’s been talking. One or two things have
reached me, you know. What we’d better do is
make an impression on him.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>“You’re not much of a slugger, are you?” Dud
shook his head. “No, I suppose not,” continued
Jimmy thoughtfully. “Well, neither am I, but I
guess there are a few tricks I could teach you. Besides,
I have a hunch that Star isn’t any fonder of
scrapping than you are. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
if you could bluff him, Dud. Of course, I
may be wrong, but that’s my idea of him.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fine idea,” said Dud sarcastically, “but
suppose you’re wrong? Then what?”</p>

<p>“Why, then you’ll have to mix it up a bit,” replied
the other quite cheerfully. “But we won’t
try it until we’ve got in shape some. We’d ought
to have a couple of pairs of light gloves. Know
any fellow who has any, Dud?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” answered the other emphatically.
“And if you think I’m going to stand up to Star
Meyer and have him knock me around just to—just
to please you, you’re horribly mistaken. Nothing
doing!”</p>

<p>“To please me! I like that! It isn’t to please
me, you silly chump; it’s for your own good. Star
is distinctly—distinctly inimical to your interests,
and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’d be distinctly inimical to my nose,”
interrupted Dud warmly. “And I like my nose the
way it is. You may not, but I do. I’m not going
to fight him, and that’s all there is to it!”</p>

<p>Jimmy was plainly disappointed. “It seems the
only way, though, Dud,” he said pleadingly. “If
you know any better way—— And besides you’ve
got a reputation for slugging to keep up. What will
fellows think if you let Star sneer at you and don’t
call him down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“You had no business telling fellows I was a
fighter,” said Dud. “You didn’t consult me about
that and I’m not responsible now for what they
think. I’m not a fighter and never was and never
could be. I don’t know anything about it. And—and
I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sighed and shrugged. “You’re extremely
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">difficile</i>, Dud,” he said in a discouraged tone. “I
plan things for you——”</p>

<p>“Plan things! I should say you did! You’re a
bully little planner, Jimmy, but I don’t like your
plans. Think up something that won’t get me
killed, please!”</p>

<p>“Piffle! What if Star did give you a black eye?
You’d have the credit of putting up a game fight
and fellows would like you better. I tell you, Dud,
a fellow’s got to risk something now and then!”</p>

<p>“You do the risking then,” replied the other a
trifle sullenly. “I don’t want any black eyes,
thanks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right then. Still, we’ve got to take Star
down a peg or two, Dud. But don’t you worry. I’ll
fix my giant intellect on the problem. Leave it all
to me, old chap.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dud bitterly, “and find myself
all beaten up some fine day! Look here, Jimmy, I
guess this thing’s gone about far enough. Let’s
drop it now. I—I guess I don’t care so much about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
being a ‘regular feller’ as I did. It—it’s too plaguey
strenuous!”</p>

<p>“Give it up just when we’re beginning to show
results?” cried Jimmy in amazement. “Never!
When I start a thing, Dud, I see it through. That’s
me, old chap. Having once set my hand to the
plow——”</p>

<p>Dud groaned in despair. “Well, then,” he muttered,
“I wish you’d go off and plow somewhere
else!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Dud, the dawn is breaking!” Jimmy
slapped him encouragingly on the back. “We’ll
make a regular feller of you yet!”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough, Jimmy, but what I want
to know is this. What’s Star Meyer going to do
when he hears that I’m telling it around school that
he’s afraid of me? It’s a wonder to me that he
hasn’t heard it already!”</p>

<p>Jimmy winked. “I sort of think he has, Dud,”
he said softly.</p>

<small>BEN MYATT ADVISES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">If, however, Starling Meyer had heard Jimmy’s
version of that encounter with Dud, he certainly
gave no sign. When he and Dud met,
which was frequently now that daily baseball
practice was going on in the cage, he either looked
over Dud’s head or deigned him a fleeting and disdainful
glance. But Dud didn’t feel at all badly
because he received no more attention. In fact, he
was extremely glad every time he looked at Star
and pondered on that youth’s wealth of muscle and
length of arm, and he hoped from the bottom of his
heart that Star would keep right on treating him
with distant disdain—the more distant the better!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jimmy, being a firm believer in preparedness,
had procured two pairs of light-weight
boxing gloves from different sources and Dud, much
against his inclination, was made to don a pair every
day before supper and do his best to master the
rudiments of self-defense. I don’t believe, just between
you and me, that Jimmy knew a whole lot
about boxing, but at least he knew more than his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
friend did. Dud was the veriest tyro and those
first lessons, undertaken by Dud with no relish and
one might well say under compulsion, were strange
affairs. With the study table drawn back to the
length of the green cord connecting droplight and
ceiling plug—the droplight met a natural fate during
the third lesson—an eight-foot “ring” was secured,
and in this, with much thudding of shoes and
thumping of gloves, the two feinted and parried and
struck. The striking, though, was somewhat one-sided
at first, Jimmy being the striker and Dud the
strikee, to coin a convenient word. Anyone pausing
outside the door of Number 19 might have heard,
in spite of the closed transom, a conversation calculated
to arouse curiosity.</p>

<p>“Watch your head now!... Well, I warned
you, didn’t I?... Keep your right in front of
you! Don’t drop your arm like that or.... Now
lead! Quick! Oh, put some pep in it, Dud!...
More like this; see?... Feint with your right
and come up quick with your left straight for my
chin!... Get it? Try it again.... That’s better,
only you’re too slow. You give it away beforehand.
Keep your eyes on mine and don’t look where
you’re going to hit.... Sorry, Dud! Was it too
hard?... You had your guard down, you see....
Quicker on your feet, old chap! Keep moving!
Don’t get set or I’ll.... I just wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
show you what would happen, Dud. Don’t get mad
about it. The only way to learn.... Good one!
You got me that time! Right on the nose! Bully
work!...”</p>

<p>After some half-dozen lessons Dud began to
learn. And Jimmy, having procured a paper-covered
book in the village which was entitled “Boxing
Self-Taught,” studied it diligently and became more
proficient. I doubt that Jimmy, even when at his
best, was what might be termed a scientific boxer,
and Dud never developed beyond the hammer-and-tongs
stage, but they got to fancying themselves
quite a bit after a fortnight or so and talked learnedly
of “hooks” and “upper-cuts” and “side-stepping”
and other mysterious things. And by that
time Dud had become really interested and viewed
Star Meyer with far less awe. In fact, though
I grieve to relate it, he even got to the point
where he speculated on what it would feel like
to place his fist in violent contact with Star’s supercilious
nose! The conclusion that he invariably arrived
at was that the sensation would be distinctly
pleasurable! But much to Jimmy’s disappointment—and
a little to Dud’s, too, I fancy—Star offered
the latter no possible excuse for doing such a thing.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of you,” grieved Jimmy. “Isn’t
that the limit? A big, husky chap like him——”</p>

<p>“He,” corrected Dud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“——Being afraid of a fellow six inches smaller,”
continued the other, superbly disregarding the interruption.
“Wouldn’t it make you weary? What
we’ve got to do, Dud, is force a quarrel on him.
There’s no use waiting for him to start anything!”</p>

<p>“Well, but why?” asked Dud doubtfully. “As
long as he isn’t bothering me——”</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> bothering you! He—he’s a thorn in your
flesh!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the other vaguely. “Is he?”</p>

<p>“Of course he is! He’s talking, too. Some of
the things he’s said have got back to me.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“Never mind what. You wouldn’t want to hear
’em, I guess.”</p>

<p>Dud laughed. “You’re making that up, Jimmy,”
he charged. “You’re just dying to get me into a
scrap with him. I wouldn’t mind—much, although
I guess he’d lick me, but I don’t see any use in
fighting him about nothing. Of course, if he <em>did</em>
anything, or <em>said</em> anything——”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I been telling you——”</p>

<p>“And I heard him say it,” added Dud hastily,
“why, that would be different.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you’re going to wait for him to knock
you down!”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” replied Dud indignantly, “but I can’t
fight him for nothing at all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“Huh!” Jimmy viewed his chum gloomily. “I
don’t see what use it is then to go to all that trouble
to learn to fight if—if you aren’t going to make use
of—of your knowledge. That’s an economical
waste, Dud. And waste is sinful.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a waste,” said Dud. “It’s a good thing
to know how to defend yourself. Besides, that boxing
business has put my arm back in shape for pitching.
It feels great nowadays. Just feel of that
muscle, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” decided the other, grudgingly. Then,
more brightly: “Say, you ought to be able to hand
Star a peach of a wallop with that, Dud! Well, all
we can do is hope for the best. We don’t want to
fight, but if we have to——”</p>

<p>“We?” queried Dud. “I don’t see where you
come into it! You’re always talking about ‘we’ fighting
Star Meyer, but it’s me——”</p>

<p>“I,” said Jimmy sweetly.</p>

<p>“It’s I, then, who would have to do it. If you
want Star licked so plaguey much why don’t you do
it yourself?”</p>

<p>Jimmy considered a moment. “Well, say, that
isn’t a bad idea,” he replied at last. “Someone
ought to do it, that’s sure! If you’re quite certain
you don’t mind——”</p>

<p>“I’m dead sure,” said Dud emphatically.</p>

<p>“Then maybe——” Jimmy felt of his arm muscles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
“I’ll think it over,” he concluded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Baseball practice had by this time really become
baseball practice. I mean by that that the period
of dumb-bell exercises and setting-up drills had
passed and the candidates, reënforced by some dozen
or so late-comers, were passing and batting and
learning the tricks of the game. The battery candidates
comprised Nate Leddy, Ben Myatt, Gus
Weston, Will Brunswick, Joe Kelly and Dud Baker,
pitchers, and Pete Gordon, Hal Cherry and Ed
Brooks, catchers. Of the pitchers, Myatt was last
year’s star and a clever twirler, Leddy was a good
man but not so dependable. Weston had speed but
little control, and the others were still unknown
quantities, except that both Kelly and Dud had
twirled a few times for the second nine the spring
before. Pete Gordon was the regular catcher
and Brooks the second-choice man. Cherry was a
beginner who showed promise. At the end of the
first two weeks of indoor work, the battery candidates
were given their first try-out one afternoon
at the conclusion of the regular practice, and Dud,
somewhat to his surprise, survived. Still, as Jimmy
kindly pointed out to him later, that didn’t mean
much since it was the custom to keep all the would-be
pitchers until the team got out of doors. Nevertheless,
Dud was encouraged and did his level best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
to make good. Myatt, a big, likable chap of eighteen
or over, took a real interest in the efforts of
the younger members of the staff and was generous
with advice and instruction. One afternoon, shortly
before the candidates got out-doors for the first time,
he took Dud in hand after practice.</p>

<p>“Say, Baker,” Ben called as Dud was leaving the
cage, “got time to pitch me a few?”</p>

<p>Dud, pulling his glove off, turned back. “Why,
yes,” he answered. “Want me to?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yell to Ed Brooks to lend me his mitt, will
you?” A minute later Ben took his place in front
of the net and thumped the big mitten encouragingly.
“All right now, boy! Try a few easy ones. That’s
nice. I say, Baker, mind if I give you a hint or
two?”</p>

<p>“I’d be awfully glad if you would,” replied Dud
eagerly. “I know I’m not much good.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“I do.” Dud smiled.</p>

<p>But Ben shook his head reprovingly. “You
ought to be the last one to say it,” he announced
gravely. “First thing you want to do, boy, is stop
tying yourself in a knot on your wind-up. You’ll
never last nine innings if you go through all that
gymnastic stuff. What’s the big idea?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” faltered Dud. “That’s the way
I’ve always done it, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t do it any more. You see if
you can’t reach the toe-plate without going through
so many motions. Cut out that second swing of
yours, why don’t you? Here’s you.” Ben went
through an exaggerated imitation of Dud’s wind-up.
“Too much work, see? If you had a man on second,
now, you couldn’t do half that, boy; he’d be
sliding into the plate before you were through. Get
your body into it and stop throwing your arm
around. It’s the body that puts the speed into the
ball. You want to start easy and work up gradually
until, when the ball leaves your hand, you’re
at the top of the pitch. The way you do it, Baker,
you get a lot of motion up and then lose it before
you pitch. And you tire yourself a lot. I couldn’t
last five innings if I threw my arms around like that.
I hope you don’t mind my criticizing you, Baker.”</p>

<p>Dud didn’t, and tried to say so, but his response
was not much more than a murmur. However, Ben
went on cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Just at first you won’t have the control you
have now, I guess, but after you’ve got on to the
hang of it you’ll find you can pitch a lot easier. Just
try it, will you?”</p>

<p>Dud’s first attempt was a complete failure, for
he started unthinkingly on that second swing, tried
to stop it and got so confused that he didn’t even
let the ball out of his hand. Ben suggested getting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
used to the wind-up before trying to pitch, and so
Dud twirled and twisted a number of times, uncomfortably
conscious of the few loiterers watching
through the netting, and finally got so that he was
able to reach the moment of delivery without falling
over his feet. But when he tried to pitch a few
straight balls into Ben Myatt’s mitten he discovered
that the change in his method had seemingly spoiled
his direction, for more than once Ben had to reach
for a wide one or else scoop one off the floor.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Ben. “You’ll get
your eye back again. That’s enough for now, I
guess. There’s one more thing I’d suggest, though,
Baker. You’re trying to pitch too many different
things. You were hooking them in and out and
dropping them and trying to float ’em, too. You
don’t need all that, boy. Not yet, anyhow. You
take my advice and learn to pitch a good straight
ball. Get so you can send it high, low, in or out or
right in the groove. Then learn to change your pace
without giving it away to the batsman. After that
there’s plenty of time for drops and hooks. I tell
you, Baker, the fellow that has control is the fellow
the batters hate to stand up to. This thing of having
fifty-seven varieties of balls doesn’t cut much
ice, old man.” Ben opened the door and gently
pushed Dud out ahead of him and they went across
to the locker-room. “A chap who can tease the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
batter with the straight ones, slip one across for a
strike now and then, follow a fast one with a slow
one and do it all without changing his style is
the fellow who wins his games. I’m not saying
hooks and floaters and all those aren’t useful, for
they are, but I do say that when a fellow’s beginning
he ought to pin his faith to just one thing, and
that’s control. Don’t be worried if they hit you
hard at first; they’re bound to; but just keep on
learning to put ’em where you want to, and the
first thing you know you’ll be fooling them worse
than the curve artist. Practice that new wind-up,
boy, and cut out all the unnecessary gee-gaws that
just use up your strength. Nine innings is a whole
month sometimes and it’s the very dickens to feel
your muscles getting sore along about the sixth.
So long, Baker. Good luck.”</p>

<p>Dud thought it over while he stood under the
shower and while he pulled on his clothes. Maybe
Ben Myatt was right, he reflected, but he was a
bit proud of his ability to “put something on the
ball” and confining himself to straight ones didn’t
sound interesting. For a moment he wondered if
Ben was trying to steer him away from his hooks
and drops so that he wouldn’t prove a rival. Then
the absurdity of that suspicion dawned and he
smiled at it. In the first place, Ben wouldn’t be in
school another year, and in the second place Dud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
was certain that he would never be able to pitch as
Ben could if he kept at it all his life! In the end, by
which time he was tying his scarf in front of one
of the little mirrors, he decided that Ben’s advice
was excellent and that he would follow it, for a
while at least.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, Hal Cherry, catching Dud
and Kelly, looked a trifle surprised and a bit disgusted,
too, when Dud’s delivery suddenly exhibited
a strange eccentricity. Cherry had to spear the air
in all directions that day, and Mr. Sargent, watching
and counseling the fellows, followed Dud’s doings
with dubious eyes. Nor was Dud perceptibly
more steady the day following, and Brooks, who
caught him, protested more than once. By that time
Dud was getting discouraged and was strongly
tempted to go back to his former more elaborate
and far more labored wind-up, and would have done
so probably had it not been for Ben Myatt’s brief
encouragement after practice.</p>

<p>“Haven’t got the hang of it yet, I see, Baker,”
remarked the veteran. “Keep on, though. It’ll
come to you in another day or two, I guess. Try
not to slow up just before your pitch, boy. That’s
your trouble now.”</p>

<p>Pondering that hint, Dud hauled Jimmy out of
bed early the next morning and conducted him out
back of the dormitory, where, stationed midway between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
two windows, he made cheerful efforts to get
his hands on the balls that Dud pitched him. Many
of them, however, bounded unchallenged from the
bricks and trickled back to Dud. One particularly
wild heave came so near a window that Dud shivered,
pocketed the ball and led the way back to the
room.</p>

<p>“If,” said Jimmy disgustedly, on the way, “that’s
a sample of what you can do with this simplified
wind-up you’re telling about you’d better go back to
the old stuff. There’s nothing in it, Dud!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to stick it out a bit longer, though,”
was the answer. “Ben says it will take time,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and patience,” said Jimmy sarcastically,
“the catcher supplying the patience. After you’ve
‘beaned’ a few batters, Dud, they’ll put you in jail
as a danger to the community. I’m glad I don’t
have to stand up to you!”</p>

<p>Two days after that, March having departed
very lamb-like, the cage was abandoned and outdoor
practice began.</p>

<small>A WILD PITCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">April at its best is an uncertain month, and
April this spring lived up to its reputation.
No sooner had the baseball candidates
grown accustomed to the feel of soft and springy
turf under their feet than a three-days’ rain began
and they were forced to retire again to the dim
and unsympathetic cage. The track and field candidates
defied weather conditions until the cinders
held pools of water and the pits became of the consistency
of oatmeal porridge. Then the sun shone
forth again and, after another day of indoor confinement,
the players once more trailed down to
Lothrop Field. The diamond was far from dry,
but the sun was warm and a little south-east breeze
promised its best efforts. Candidates for the second
team were called out that afternoon, and Jimmy,
whose status with the first was still a matter for conjecture,
thought seriously of returning to the fold.
Dud, however, refused to sanction the step and so
Jimmy grumblingly stayed where he was.</p>

<p>“I know just how it’ll be, though,” he said pessimistically.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
“They’ll keep me here until Crowley’s
got his second team all made up and then they’ll
drop me. Oh, all right!” He stretched his legs
and leaned more comfortably back against the railing
of the stand. “After all, it’s too nice a day to do
anything. I pity those poor dubs out there catching
flies and wrenching their arms throwing the ball in.
Me for the quiet, untroubled life of a substitute outfielder.
You’ll have to go in and pitch pretty quick,
Dud; Pete’s got his eye on you now; but I’ll just
sit here and keep this bench warm and——”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s remarks were rudely interrupted.</p>

<p>“Hi, Logan!” called Mr. Sargent. “Go on out
there to left and get your hands on some of those
flies. Lively, now! Send Boynton in.”</p>

<p>Jimmy arose with alacrity, casting a despairing
glance at Dud, and ambled off. Hugh Ordway,
seated further along the bench, got up and joined
Dud.</p>

<p>“Awfully pretty, isn’t it?” observed Hugh, nodding
toward the wide expanse of new green that led
away to the ribbon of river beyond. “Reminds me
a lot of home—I mean England.” It sounded as if
he was correcting himself, and Dud asked:</p>

<p>“But England is your home, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Hugh nodded. “I suppose it is, only when I’m
here I like to remember that I’m part American, if
you know what I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Your mother is American, isn’t she?” asked
Dud.</p>

<p>“Yes, she was born in Maryland. Her folks have
lived there for a long time. It’s a bit odd, Baker,
but sometimes I feel as if I were more U. S. A. than
British. Being sort of half-and-half like that, a fellow
doesn’t quite know where he is, if you know
what I mean!”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” murmured Dud. It was the first
time that Hugh Ordway had ever approached him,
and he felt rather embarrassed. The desire to make
a good impression on the other only resulted in
tying his tongue up. But Hugh appeared not to notice
the fact.</p>

<p>“How are you getting on,” he asked, “with your
bowl—your pitching?”</p>

<p>“Just fair, I guess. How do you like it? Baseball,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“Crazy about it! I’ll never learn to play decently,
I fancy, but it’s a jolly game, isn’t it? What I like
best is batting, only I can’t seem to hit the ball very
well yet. Myatt fools me every time, you know. I
got a couple of good ones off Nate Leddy the other
day, though. Are you pitching today?”</p>

<p>“I guess Pete will put me in for an inning or
two later. He’s giving us all a chance now. I—I’m
pretty rotten so far.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t found yourself yet, I fancy. It takes a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
bit of time, eh? Bert says a lot of us will be
dropped to the second pretty soon. I say, Baker,
I wasn’t thinking of you, you know!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get dropped, all right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Hope not, I’m sure. In my own case I wouldn’t
mind a bit. Maybe I could play well enough to
make the second. Or a class team perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I thought you—you fielded very well the other
day,” said Dud politely.</p>

<p>Hugh laughed. “You’re spoofing, I fancy. I did
catch a few, but I was beastly scared of them. Bert
says I looked as if I were going to catch them in my
mouth! Odd feeling you have when those balls
begin to come down, getting bigger and bigger every
second, and you’re wondering whether you’ll catch
them or if they’ll hit you on the nose! Jolly good
fun, though! Corking! Lots more exciting than
cricket.”</p>

<p>“Is it? I never played cricket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no end! Cricket’s a bully good game, too,
but it’s a lot more quiet and—er—sedate, if you
know what I mean. Well, I’ll toddle. Hope you
get on finely, Baker. And drop in some time, eh?”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Dud. Then, as Hugh
moved away, he blurted: “Did you really mean
that, Ordway?”</p>

<p>“What? Why, of course!”</p>

<p>“Then—then I will. I didn’t know——” Dud’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
voice trailed off into silence as he dropped an embarrassed
gaze. Hugh smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>“Right-o, Baker! Glad to have you.”</p>

<p>Dud, wishing he hadn’t made such a fool of himself,
bent stern attention on his glove until the red
had subsided from his cheeks. “He will think me an
awful kid,” he reflected. “Asking things like that
and—and blushing like a silly girl! And of course
he couldn’t say anything else. You won’t catch me
going!”</p>

<p>Further self-communing was cut short by Mr.
Sargent. “All right, Baker,” called the coach.
“Warm up, will you? Brooks will catch you. See
if you can’t steady down today.”</p>

<p>Dud squirmed out of his sweater, pulled his glove
on and joined Ed Brooks in front of the first-base
stand. Brunswick had taken Kelly’s place in the
box and it would be Dud’s turn next. As Brooks
tossed the ball to him and spread his hands invitingly
wide apart Dud hoped hard that he would be
able to steady down, but doubted it. As yet the
recollection of that impulsive question to Ordway
still made his face burn. Consequently when, after
pitching a half-dozen easy ones to warm his arm,
he began to put on a little speed, he was pleased as
well as surprised to find that some of his old control
had come back. Encouraged, he made greater efforts
to put the ball where he wanted to and, unconsciously,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
began to “steam up.” But Brooks cautioned
him and Dud slowed down.</p>

<p>“That’s pitching ’em,” called Brooks. “They’re
all straight, though, Dud, or pretty near it. Try a
slant.”</p>

<p>But Dud resisted the temptation to “hook” one
and shook his head. Instead, he sent over a slow
one that fooled Brooks completely and brought
from the latter a laugh at his own expense. “Do it
again,” he urged, as he threw the ball back. “I
want to get used to those.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait until you’re not expecting it,” laughed
Dud.</p>

<p>There was no line-up today, but first and second-string
players were batting and running the bases,
taking their places in the field ultimately to let others
come in. Weston, Kelly and Brunswick had held
the mound for an inning or two apiece, while Ben
Myatt and Nate Leddy were trying to improve their
hitting, a thing that the latter was rather weak at.
Presently the outfielders were called in in a body and
others took their places, and changes were made in
the infield. Brunswick went to the shower and Dud
to the pitcher’s box. Pete Gordon was still catching.</p>

<p>“All right, Baker!” called Pete. “Strike ’em out,
boy. Put her over now.”</p>

<p>Neil Ayer fouled one and then landed on the
next and went to first, and Bert Winslow took his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
place. The pitchers were not expected to work
hard, for a batsman stayed in until he hit or was
caught out. Bert was difficult to dispose of, since he
cannily refused everything that wasn’t distinctly a
strike, and Dud pitched a dozen deliveries before
Bert found one he liked and rapped it to deep center.
Meanwhile Mr. Sargent was coaching Ayer
from first to second and on to third, making him
slide to every base even though he was not threatened.
When, however, he tried to steal home on
Dud’s wind-up, Dud managed to keep his head, send
in a fast one and saw Ayer nailed a yard from the
rubber.</p>

<p>It wasn’t especially interesting work and some of
the hits were screechers into deep right, left or center
that the outfielders couldn’t begin to get their
hands onto. Dud had not had much experience in
fielding his position and was momentarily in fear
that a hot liner would come at his head. If one did,
he was quite certain he would duck and quite disgrace
himself. But when, after some nine or ten
batters had faced him, Captain Murtha hit one
squarely on the nose and it came straight at Dud,
the latter involuntarily put up his hands and, while
he didn’t make the catch, knocked it down, recovered
it and tossed out Murtha at first. He got a
round of applause from the stand for that, which
so rattled him that his next delivery shot past Gordon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
a good four feet to his right and let in a runner
from third. The batter sent the next one off on a
voyage to deep center and took two bases. The
base-runners were taking such extraordinary chances
and Mr. Sargent was making such a hullabaloo back
of first that Dud began to lose his control badly,
and he was forced to put exactly eleven balls across
before Weston, tired of waiting for a good one,
reached for a wide ball and fouled out to first-baseman.</p>

<p>Then Star Meyer faced him and Dud made up his
mind to make Star work for his hit. Star viewed
the pitcher with amused contempt and Dud felt his
cheeks tingle. But he set his teeth and sent a high
one across that the batter disdained and followed it
with one that barely cut the inner corner of the plate
and was just knee-high. Star looked doubtful about
it, but Gordon proclaimed it “a daisy, Star! They
don’t come any better.” That apparently impressed
Star, for he swung hard at the succeeding delivery,
which, happening to be one of Dud’s slow ones,
crossed the plate almost a second after the swing!
Someone laughed and Star frowned haughtily. Dud
tempted him with another wide one and then sneaked
one across right in the groove and caught the batter
napping. Gordon thumped the ball into his glove
before he threw it back, a signal of commendation
with the big catcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Baker!” he called. “That’s
pitching ’em, boy!”</p>

<p>Dud tried another slow one and again Star swung
too soon and again a laugh greeted the performance.
This time, with the ripple of laughter, came
a smatter of applause from the handful of spectators
on the stand. Star’s countenance lost its
haughtiness and his mouth set grimly. Dud decided
that he might as well let Star hit and get rid of him,
and so he tried to put one over shoulder-high and
across the middle of the plate. But something went
wrong. Dud was convinced afterwards that his
foot had turned on a pebble. At all events, instead
of traveling straight and true into Gordon’s waiting
mitt, the ball took an erratic slant and brought up
against Star’s shoulder. There was speed on the ball
and the batter had scarcely tried to dodge it, and
now he dropped his bat, clapped a hand to his
shoulder and performed a series of most unconventional
steps about the plate. Dud started toward
him, but Gordon was already at his side and so Dud
contented himself with a sincere “Awfully sorry,
Meyer!”</p>

<p>But Star, impatiently throwing off the catcher’s
hand, turned an angry countenance to Dud. “You
meant to do that, Baker! You did it on purpose.
I’ll get you for it, too! You can’t——”</p>

<p>But Mr. Sargent interposed then. “Tut, tut,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Meyer! It was purely an accident. You must learn
to get out of the way of them. Sorry if it hurt you,
though. Get Davy to rub it for you. That’ll do for
today.”</p>

<p>Star, pausing to cast a final ominous look at Dud,
recovered his poise and, rubbing his injury, retired
haughtily. Many amused glances followed him,
for no one there doubted that it had been purely
accidental and Star’s loss of temper had struck them
as unnecessary. The incident ended Dud’s usefulness
for that day, for his delivery became so wild
that Mr. Sargent quickly took him out, putting in
Weston to finish the practice.</p>

<p>Dud, yielding the ball shamefacedly, retired to
the bench and donned his sweater. He was quite
aware of the fact that Mr. Sargent meant him to
return to the Field House, but the thought of the
irate Star Meyer, who, by the time Dud got there,
would doubtless be just getting into his clothes, deterred
him. Instead, then, of leaving the field, Dud
found a place on the bench and pretended deep absorption
in the practice. Presently, though, a better
idea presented itself. Across on the other diamond
the second was putting in its first day of work under
the tuition of “Dinny,” as Mr. Crowley, the assistant
physical director, was called. He would,
he decided, wander over there as unostentatiously as
possible, and so escape Mr. Sargent’s eagle eye. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
it proved a mistaken move, for just at the moment
that Dud detached himself from the few idlers on
the bench, Mr. Sargent happened to look across the
diamond, and his impatient voice quickly followed
his glance.</p>

<p>“Baker! Go ahead in! I told you once!”</p>

<p>The fellows on the bench grinned and Dud tried
his best to make it appear that he wanted nothing
better in life than to do that very thing! But, just
the same, once behind the stand and out of view of
those on the diamond, his feet moved very slowly
along the path. I don’t believe that Dud was a coward,
for one may have no stomach for physical combat
and yet be brave enough in other ways, but I
am quite certain that he wished heartily all the way
across to the Field House that the tall and dignified
form of Star Meyer would appear at the doorway
and proceed homeward before he reached there!
But nothing of the sort happened, and when Dud
entered the locker-room he was just in time to hear
Star finish an account of the recent episode for the
benefit of three boys who lolled on the benches in
various stages of undress.</p>

<p>“He was afraid to give me one I could hit and so
he whanged one straight at me. I wasn’t looking
for it and couldn’t get out of the way, and it got me
right on the shoulder. He threw it as hard as he
could, too, and that arm will be out of commission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
for days. Pete had the cheek to tell me that it was
an accident! Accident! Yes, it was—not! You
wait till I get a chance at that fresh kid!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>JIMMY TAKES CHARGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dud’s first impulse was to turn back, but one
of Star’s audience had seen him already, and
so, after a moment of hesitation, he went
on and, since Star had his back toward the door,
reached his locker before the speaker saw him.
Then there was an instant’s silence. Dud pulled
open the locker door, took his towel out and dropped
it on the bench. Then:</p>

<p>“Got canned, did you?” asked Star. “Maybe
you’ll learn after a while that you can’t do that sort
of thing and get away with it.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to hit you, Meyer, honestly,” returned
Dud. “I—I’m awfully sorry. There was a
pebble or something——”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget your pebbles! You know very well
you meant to hit me. You’ve been doing a lot of
talking around school lately. I’ve heard it. And
I’d have given you a mighty good spanking if you’d
been big enough to notice.” Star had walked around
the end of the bench and now faced Dud like an outraged
Jove from a yard away. Dud tried hard to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
appear undisturbed, but the mere publicity was
enough to send the blood into his cheeks and put a
tremor in his voice as he answered.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been talking about you, Meyer,” he
said as stoutly as he could. “And, anyhow, you
needn’t try to bully me. I’ve apologized for that—that
accident, and that’s all I can do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you apologize, do you?” Star laughed
amusedly. “Well, apologies don’t answer, kid. If
you weren’t so small I’d kick you around the room,
you—you ugly-faced little insect!”</p>

<p>“Never mind my size!” cried Dud, throwing discretion
to the winds in the sudden flare of anger.
“And never mind about my looks, either! Any time
you want to start kicking you go ahead, Meyer! I’m
not afraid of you! You’re a bluff, a big bluff, that’s
all you——”</p>

<p>Star’s right hand shot out suddenly and the open
palm landed hard on Dud’s cheek. The blow sent
him sprawling across the bench, but he was on his
feet again in an instant, his face white save where
the impact of Star’s hand had left a tingling red
stain. Star, smiling crookedly, had stepped back,
ready for Dud’s rush. But the rush wasn’t made,
for at that instant “Davy” Richards’ voice came
sternly from the doorway.</p>

<p>“Here, boys! Stop that! Look you, Meyer,
leave him alone! What mean you hitting a boy beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
your size, eh?” Davy was Welsh and when
excited relapsed into a brogue as broad as it was
difficult of reproduction in type. Star looked
around, shrugged his shoulders and laughed
lightly.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t hitting him, Davy. I merely slapped
his face for him. If I ever really hit him he’d
know it!”</p>

<p>“Well, no more of it in this house! ’Tis no place
for fighting. And you there, you, Baker, behave
yourself, do you hear me? No more now or I’ll
take a hand myself!” Davy retired grumbling, and
one of the audience of three chuckled as he got up
and sauntered out. The others exchanged glances
of amusement and went on with their dressing. Star
nonchalantly retired to his own bench, leaving Dud
standing with clenched fists and angry face in the
middle of the floor, for once unconscious of the curious
gazes of others.</p>

<p>“It isn’t finished yet, Meyer,” he said at last in a
low voice.</p>

<p>Star glanced up contemptuously. “You’ll be finished
if you try any more funny stunts with me,
Baker,” he said threateningly. “And I want you to
stop talking about me, too. Hear that? The next
time I’ll do a lot more than slap your ugly face for
you!”</p>

<p>“You’ll fight me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t bother to!” Star laughed. “I might
break you in two if I hit you!”</p>

<p>“You’ll fight me,” reiterated Dud doggedly. “If
you won’t——”</p>

<p>He stopped, for Davy was glowering at him from
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Look you, Baker, what I say I mean! One
more word about fighting while you’re in this place
and out you go!”</p>

<p>Dud subsided and silence reigned until the door
opened to admit a number of released second team
candidates, by which time Dud was ready for his
shower. When he returned to the lockers Star had
gone. By that time the room was crowded from end
to end, for practice was over and some forty-odd
boys were struggling for space. Jimmy spied his
chum and pushed his way to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dud, it was fine!” he whispered delightedly.
“Only why didn’t you put it a foot or so higher and
‘bean’ him? Did you see him again?”</p>

<p>Dud nodded.</p>

<p>“Was he mad?” demanded Jimmy eagerly.
“Hello, what are you looking so funny about? You
didn’t—I say, Dud, you two didn’t——” He
paused expressively.</p>

<p>“We had words,” replied Dud in low tones, “and
he—slapped my face.”</p>

<p>“Slapped——” Jimmy whistled. Then: “Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
stuff, Dud! What did you do? Where were you?
I wish I’d seen it!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do anything. Davy butted in. I’m going
to fight him, though.”</p>

<p>“Of course! Slapped your face, eh, the big bully?
That—that’s a fighting matter, Dud. When are
you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“He refused; said he wouldn’t bother with me;
said he might break me in two! But he’s got to
fight, Jimmy!”</p>

<p>“You bet he has!” agreed Jimmy enthusiastically.
“But listen: let me get my shower. You wait for
me, will you? We’ve got to talk this over, you
know.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything to talk over,” said Dud
flatly. “He’s got to fight me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if he says he won’t—— You wait for
me, see? I won’t be a minute.” And Jimmy, beaming
broadly, dashed off.</p>

<p>Dud found a corner by the door and waited, listening
idly to the chatter of the fellows. Nearby
Foster Tray, struggling with a stubborn shirt, remarked
in smothered tones:</p>

<p>“Did you see Baker peg Star in the arm, Mil?
It was a fierce old biff!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Oscar Milford, “and Star was
hopping mad.” He chuckled. “Said Baker did it
on purpose. Well, maybe he did. I don’t know.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
But they say Baker’s got Star scared of him, for
some reason.”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! A kid like that? Not likely! But
it isn’t sense getting mad about being hit with a ball.
Gee, if I got peeved every time I got whacked last
year——”</p>

<p>A good-natured altercation over the possession
of a bath towel that both Leddy and Parker
laid claim to drowned the rest of Tray’s remark
and Dud slipped further along. Captain Murtha
ran across him a moment later and stopped an
instant.</p>

<p>“Say, Baker, you did mighty well there for a
while today. Keep it up, old man. But don’t lay
out any more of the team, eh? You might leave us
short-handed!” Guy laughed, nodded and went on,
and presently, showing numerous evidences of having
dressed hurriedly, Jimmy arrived a bit breathless
and dragged Dud outside. There, one arm
through Dud’s, he led the way back to the dormitory.</p>

<p>“Now,” he demanded eagerly, “let’s have the
whole story.”</p>

<p>“Well, I stepped on a pebble or something and
the ball got away and hit Star on the shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” chuckled Jimmy, “I saw that. Something
ought to be done about those pebbles!” And he
winked meaningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“But it was a pebble!” declared Dud. “I didn’t
mean to hit him!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t!” Jimmy was incredulous, incredulous
and disappointed. “Gee, I thought of course
you did it so he’d get mad and fight! Are you
sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” answered Dud shortly. “Don’t be
a fool, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, then. It was an accident.” Jimmy
sighed. “Then what?”</p>

<p>Dud brought the narrative to its conclusion by
the time they were crossing the campus, and Jimmy
disengaged his arm in order to slap Dud approvingly
on the back. “Fine!” he declared. “Just
what we wanted! By the time we put this thing
through, Dud, you’ll be the most talked-of fellow in
school!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be talked of. I’m sick of all
that rot. All I want is to show Star Meyer that he
can’t slap me and—and get away with it!”</p>

<p>“Sure! But it’ll do you a lot of good if you lick
him, don’t you see? Fellows will call you a plucky
kid and all that. Oh, there’s nothing to it, Dud!
Here’s where we make good, old son!”</p>

<p>“I’m not likely to lick him,” replied the other
quietly. “I dare say he will beat me to a pulp,
but he won’t do it before I’ve got in a few,” he
added grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“That’s all right, too, but it’s going to make a lot
bigger hit if you get the decision,” responded Jimmy.
“No, you’d better make up your mind to lick him,
Dud.”</p>

<p>“Make up my mind!” replied the other impatiently
as they traveled together down the corridor.
“How’s making up my mind going to help? He can
lick me, and you know it. And I know it. What’s
the good of talking rot like that?”</p>

<p>“How do you know he can?” asked Jimmy eagerly.
“I’ll bet you anything Star’s got a yellow
streak in him somewhere. And you’ve been learning
right along, haven’t you? Why, say, I call you a
mighty clever boxer right this minute, Dud! Yes,
I do, honest! And—I say, what time is it? Fine!
We’ve just got time to put on the gloves for a few
minutes. I was reading in that book——”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to put on the gloves,” answered
Dud decidedly. “I’ll fight him just as I am. All
that scientific stuff isn’t much good, anyway. It
didn’t keep him from almost knocking me flat on the
floor this afternoon, did it?”</p>

<p>“But you weren’t looking for it! If you’d
known——”</p>

<p>“Besides, the thing is to get him to fight. He says
he won’t. How can I make him, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“We-ell——” Jimmy studied the question with
his head on one side and his mouth pursed. At last:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
“There are two or three ways, I guess. You might
challenge him publicly or you might just walk up
and slap his face the way he slapped yours or you
might——”</p>

<p>“That’s good enough,” interrupted Dud. “Come
on!”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To find him!”</p>

<p>“Well, but—but wait! Hold on! See here, Dud,
you can’t walk into a fellow’s room and biff him, you
know!”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Because it isn’t done, old chap. Violation of—er—hospitality
and all that, you know. What you
want to do is to find him some time when other fellows
are around, see? Then he can’t possibly refuse.
But you want to make sure that a faculty isn’t
looking! Better wait now until morning and get
him in School Hall; in the corridor, say. Yes, that’s
the idea. There’ll be a crowd around, and——”</p>

<p>“I’d rather do it now,” said Dud. “Maybe—by
tomorrow—I might not—might not want to so
much!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I’ll keep you up to it, son.
Trust me. You see, Dud, this is a wonderful opportunity
and we want to make the most of it. You
wait until the morning and then find Star in the corridor
between recitations. There’s bound to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
crowd there. Imagine the sensation when you step
up to him and let him have it right on the cheek!
Maybe you’d ought to say something, too, something—er—effective.
Let’s see now. Suppose——”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jimmy, this isn’t any silly pageant!
I don’t care whether anyone’s around or not. All
you think about is making a public show of it! You
make me tired!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” returned Jimmy indignantly.
“All I say is that if you’re going to do it
you ought to do it right! What’s the good of balling
it all up when, by using a little—er—a little
headwork, you can make a great big hit? No, sir,
you listen to me. I’m managing you in this affair,
Dud. Just you sit still and leave the whole business
to me.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to you——” began Dud bitterly.</p>

<p>“Besides, I’ve got a better scheme, old chap!
Let’s do it shipshape, eh? After supper I’ll call on
Star and take your challenge to him. Then, if he
says he won’t fight, we’ll go ahead with the public
insult scheme. But that will be giving him a chance
to accept like a gentleman. And, of course, whether
he accepts or doesn’t, the thing is just bound to leak
out.” Jimmy grinned. “Those things always do.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Dud moodily, “I’d kept my mouth
shut and not told you anything about it. You’re
bound to go and hire a brass band and make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
hullabaloo! I dare say”—sarcastically—“you’ll be
selling tickets for the fight!”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that isn’t a bad idea! I don’t mean to
sell tickets, but we might issue invitations or—or
something. ‘You are cordially invited to be present
at an informal scrap between Dudley Baker and
Starling Meyer at five-thirty on Friday. R. S.
V. P.’”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d quit making a silly joke of it,” complained
Dud. “If you think it’s so terribly funny,
why don’t you fight him yourself?”</p>

<p>“I would in a minute if he slapped my face,” replied
Jimmy promptly. “Maybe he will when I
take the challenge to him. Gee, I wish he’d try it!
Still, I suppose you’d claim the right to the first
scrap. Well, that’s settled, then. Come on to supper
now. Better be sort of careful what you eat,
you know. You want to keep in condition. What
do you say to tomorrow afternoon before supper
down at the Beach? We’d be out of sight there and
it would be handy for fellows to get to after practice.
No use staging the affair too far away if we
want a good attendance, eh? Got to consider folks’
comfort some, you know. All ready?”</p>

<small>THE CHALLENGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Come in!”</p>

<p>Starling Meyer turned from the window
in Number 17 and faced the door. Ernest
Barnes, Star’s roommate, looked up from his
book and glanced curiously in the same direction as
the portal opened briskly to admit Jimmy Logan. It
lacked but a few minutes of study hour and Jimmy,
with the door of the next room slightly ajar, had
made certain of Star’s return before starting on his
errand. Beyond the partition—there was a connecting
door between the rooms, but that was never opened—Dud
was dubiously awaiting Jimmy’s report.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Star eloquently as Jimmy advanced
jauntily enough but with a most sober countenance
into the radius of light from the study table.
“Hello, Logan, what do you want?”</p>

<p>Barnes’ greeting was just a nod, civil but not enthusiastic,
and having made it he went back to his
book.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows,” said Jimmy. “Mind if I sit
down, Meyer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Help yourself.” Star eyed the caller suspiciously.
“This is an unexpected honor,” he added
sarcastically.</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded. “Yes, isn’t it? Fact is, I’m on
a painful errand, Meyer. Mind if I speak before
Barnes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut the comedy, Logan,” replied Star impatiently.
“What nonsense are you up to, anyway?”</p>

<p>“No nonsense at all, really,” Jimmy assured him
earnestly. “It’s like this, Meyer. I’m here on
behalf of my friend, Baker. You see, he isn’t
just satisfied with the way things were left this
afternoon. He feels that—er—the matter ought to
be settled more—er—more definitely. See what I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! I’m not going to fight that kid, Logan.
He’s too small. Tell him to forget it. And
look here, you!” Star’s voice took on an edge. “I
want you to quit meddling in my affairs, too, Logan.
I know what you’ve been up to. You and
that roommate of yours are altogether too
fresh.”</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Jimmy innocently. “What have I
done, Meyer?”</p>

<p>“You’ve talked a whole lot too much, that’s what
you’ve done. And you’ve egged Baker on to—to
make trouble. I want you to stop it, both of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I may have talked some,” Jimmy allowed
calmly. “Everyone has a right to talk——”</p>

<p>“If they’re careful what they say, yes! But——”</p>

<p>“Anyway, that isn’t what I came to see you about.
I’ve talked it over with Dud and we’ve concluded
that you ought to give him satisfaction. You see,
Meyer, slapping a fellow’s face and then refusing
to go on with it looks—well, a bit funny, eh? Now
what we propose is that you and Dud meet, say tomorrow
afternoon at half-past five, down at the
Beach, and settle the matter in a quiet, gentlemanly
way. What do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“I say no,” replied Star shortly. “I haven’t any
intention of fighting him. All I will do is slap his
face again if he doesn’t let me alone. He’s been
telling it around—or you have—that I’m afraid of
him!”</p>

<p>“Um,” said Jimmy thoughtfully. “Well—er—if
you don’t fight him won’t it look as if he was
right?”</p>

<p>Star flushed angrily. “Don’t be a fool, Logan!
I’d take the two of you on and lick the tar out of
you if it wasn’t beneath me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! Then I’m to tell Dud that you refuse?”</p>

<p>“Tell him anything you like! And now you get
out of here or I’ll throw you out!”</p>

<p>Barnes had displayed a remarkable aloofness up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
to the present moment, but now he raised his eyes at
last from his book and judicially, even hopefully,
compared the two before him. The result of the
comparison, however, seemed to disappoint him,
for he sighed and went back to his occupation
again, apparently dismissing the matter from his
mind.</p>

<p>“And what would I be doing?” asked Jimmy
brightly. “I’ll tell you frankly, Meyer, that your
attitude is a great surprise to me. It’s a great disappointment,
too. I’d hoped for better things,
Meyer. The fellows are going to be mightily disappointed
when they hear about it.”</p>

<p>“So you intend to talk some more, do you?” demanded
the other exasperatedly.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, my, no! But these things have a way
of getting out, you know, Meyer.” Jimmy shook
his head sadly. “This school is a frightfully gossipy
little community.” He got up and turned toward
the door. “If you think better of it, all you’ve
got to do is just let me know. I wish you’d think it
over, Meyer.”</p>

<p>“You get out of here!” retorted Star threateningly.</p>

<p>“I’m going. I don’t know what Dud will say,
though, when I tell him!”</p>

<p>“I fancy,” sneered Star, “that he will be a good
bit relieved!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“Dud? Oh, dear, no!” responded Jimmy gently.
“He’s awfully keen about it, Dud is. It’ll be a horrible
disappointment to him, Meyer. Well, so
long.”</p>

<p>Jimmy passed out with melancholy mien, closing
the door softly behind him and then pausing an instant
to chuckle before he opened the next portal.
A moment later his expression of wicked glee
changed to one of utmost decorum, for to his surprise
he found that Dud had a visitor and that the
visitor was none other than Mr. Russell. Mr. Russell,
better known as “J. P.,” was the Greek instructor
and one of the house masters in Trow.
Jimmy said “Good evening, sir,” in the most deferential
tones, shot a quick, inquiring glance at Dud
and then paused uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Am I in the way, Mr. Russell?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not at all, Logan. I’ve finished my business
with Baker. Possibly I’d better acquaint you with
it and enlist your assistance.” Mr. Russell smiled
gently. “We’ve heard that Baker had a quarrel
this afternoon with another boy and was heard to
threaten him. As you know, both of you, fighting
is not tolerated here, and I felt it my duty to drop
in and warn Baker against—ah—any infringement
of the rules. He has explained the circumstances
and I must acknowledge that he has grounds for—ah—complaint.
But the matter must be settled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
amicably, boys, and I shall depend on you, Logan, as
an older boy, to see that your friend here does nothing
he will be sorry for. Personally, I believe that
there is something to be said for—ah—a physical
encounter under such circumstances, but rules are
rules and we are here to obey them. You agree with
me, Logan?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, sir,” replied Jimmy emphatically.</p>

<p>“Then I may depend on you to see that nothing
occurs which—ah——”</p>

<p>“You may, sir,” said Jimmy resolutely. “In fact,
I’ve already been talking it over with Dud, Mr. Russell,
and I’m certain he doesn’t intend to make any
trouble. You see, just at first he was a bit peeved.
Any fellow would have been if another fellow had
slapped his face like that. But after I’d talked to
him a while——”</p>

<p>Jimmy paused because Dud was grinning and Mr.
Russell had emitted what was an unmistakable
chuckle.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Logan, your counsel didn’t prevail,
after all,” said the instructor, “for I found Baker
in a decidedly uncompromising state of mind. I
think you’d better have another talk with him.” Mr.
Russell arose, still smiling, and moved to the door.
“My advice to both you boys is to be sensible. Good
evening.”</p>

<p>“Now what the dickens did he mean by that?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
asked Jimmy, frowning perplexedly after the instructor.
Dud laughed.</p>

<p>“He meant that your bluff didn’t fool him a bit,
you silly ass, if you want to know. I told him I
meant to fight Meyer the first chance I got. Then
you came in and began talking too much, as usual.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Jimmy, grinning. “So that’s it?
Well, now what’s to be done? I put it up to Star
and he ab-so-lutely refused the invitation.”</p>

<p>“I guess that ends it,” said Dud. “I certainly
don’t intend to have any scrap with him now when
faculty’s on the watch. J. P. says they’d chuck me
if I got caught at it. He’s not a bad sort, J. P.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it the very dickens!” muttered Jimmy,
plunging his hands in his pockets and viewing his
chum forlornly. “Just when everything was coming
around our way, too!”</p>

<p>Dud shrugged philosophically. “I’ll get even with
him some time, even if I can’t fight him now,” he
declared grimly. “Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that isn’t going to help us much now,”
replied Jimmy perplexedly. “You see, I insisted that
you were crazy for a scrap and Star will think——”</p>

<p>“Oh, who cares what Star thinks? Who cares
what anybody thinks?” asked Dud impatiently.
“I’m sick of the whole business.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to save our faces, though,” said the
other, shaking his head. “And so I guess——”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
His face lighted suddenly. “That’s the ticket! By
Jove, Dud, we’ll get credit out of this yet!”</p>

<p>“What silly scheme are you thinking about now?”
asked his chum dubiously.</p>

<p>“Why, all we’ve got to do is to tell the truth!”</p>

<p>“<em>All?</em>” asked Dud sarcastically. “I’d say that
was a whole lot for you to try, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, just let it get around that faculty got
wind of the thing and, knowing your reputation as
a scrapper, sent J. P. to forbid you to fight! Great
stuff, that!” Jimmy laughed delightedly. “Why,
it’s almost as good as the scrap!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jimmy, I’m tired of the whole thing,
I tell you. Let it drop, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Only we’ve got to have the last word,
Dud! Now don’t pester me any more. I’ve got to
dig a bit.”</p>

<p>But if Jimmy really studied, appearances were deceptive,
for when, during the next hour, Dud occasionally
glanced across the table, it was always to
behold Jimmy with his hands locked behind his head,
his gaze on the ceiling and a thoughtfully rapturous
smile on his face. After study hour was over he
disappeared.</p>

<p>Dud asked no questions the next day. As he had
truthfully told Jimmy, he was tired of the whole affair.
He was still deeply resentful toward Star
Meyer, but his anger had cooled and he had no intention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
of getting into trouble with the faculty for
the scant satisfaction of being bruised up further
by that youth. He was tired, too, of trying to become
“a regular feller,” to use Jimmy’s descriptive
phrase. What the latter liked to call “the campaign”
had been, so far as beneficial results were
concerned, a total failure. To be sure, Dud had
enlarged his circle of acquaintances vastly; he was
now on nodding or speaking acquaintance with fully
three-fourths of the fellows; but what, as he asked
himself disconsolately, was the good of knowing
chaps if they didn’t like you afterwards? He could
still count on the fingers of one hand the fellows
who really showed any disposition to be friendly:
Hugh Ordway, Ben Myatt, Guy Murtha, Roy Dresser
and Ed Brooks. He tried in vain to find a sixth.
There was Jimmy, of course, but Jimmy was understood.
Of the friendly ones only Ordway and Dresser
could be called disinterested, he decided. Murtha
was friendly because he wanted Dud to make
good as a pitcher, Myatt because he took a sort of
proprietary interest in the younger twirler, and
Brooks because it had fallen to his lot to catch Dud
frequently, and there had sprung up between them a
sort of comradeship that, so far, ended with each
day’s work-out. As to Hugh Ordway, Dud suspected
that that youth showed friendliness because
he was naturally kind-hearted and had taken pity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
on him. So that left only Roy Dresser, and Dresser
was much older than Dud and went with the football
crowd and, in the natural course of events,
their paths seldom crossed. It would have been perfectly
feasible for Dud to call on Dresser, but that
would have required an amount of assurance that
the younger boy didn’t possess. No, judging by results,
that “campaign” had not been a colossal success!</p>

<p>Just now, however, Dud didn’t care so much
whether he was popular or not. He was very full
of baseball and secretly consumed by the ambition
to make good as a pitcher and win a place on the
first team. For the present that provided sufficient
interest. He didn’t really believe that he would
succeed in his ambition; at least, not this year; but
one may lack belief and still hope, and Dud was doing
a whole lot of hoping. So far he had done as
well as any of the “rookies” without, however, having
distinguished himself in the least. He could
flatter himself that neither Brunswick nor Kelly had
been used more often than he, and he took encouragement
from the fact. Sometimes he regretted that
he had taken Ben Myatt’s advice and changed his
style. If he hadn’t, he told himself, he might have
showed a lot more by this time. Generally, though,
he recognized the fact that Ben’s advice had really
been very sensible and that eventually, if not this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
season, then next, he would find himself better off
for having followed it. So far, though, the improvement
that Ben had promised had developed
very slowly, and he had days of discouragement. It
seemed that what accuracy he had possessed before
had quite left him. He could show speed and he
could fool four batsmen out of five with his change
of pace, but when the score got to be two-and-two
and it was necessary to put them over he was as
likely as not to be as wild as a hawk. Obeying Ben,
he still avoided “hooks,” making up his mind to
leave such things quite alone until he was able to
put the straight ones where he wanted them. Plenty
of pitchers will tell you that it is harder to pitch a
straight ball than a curve, and it’s very nearly true.
It is, in fact, entirely true in the case of a young
pitcher who has started out pitching curves to the
practical exclusion of straight balls. And Dud,
having taught himself very largely, had begun his
pitching career on the erroneous assumption that a
wide knowledge of “hooks” and “curves” and
“jumps” and other freakish things is a pitcher’s
best asset. It is not, though, for the simple reason
that no pitcher ever combined a large variety of
deliveries with that most valuable of all assets, control.
“Putting it where you want it” is what counts,
and the pitcher who can put a straight ball just
where it will do the most good can dispose of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
batsman in far better style than one whose wide
curves and drops and jumps refuse to break over
the plate. All this Dud learned for himself eventually,
but just now he was accepting it on faith, and
his faith often failed him.</p>

<p>The day after Mr. Russell’s visit to Number 19
Dud very carefully avoided a meeting with Star
Meyer. When he left his room he listened to make
sure that his neighbor was not also about to emerge,
and in School Hall he searched the corridors between
recitations in order that he would not find
himself embarrassingly confronted by Star. When
you have earnestly vowed to make another fellow
fight it is a bit disconcerting to have to pass him by
meekly! Dud’s endeavors met with complete success
until he entered the Field House in the afternoon
to get into his playing togs. Then, as he
feared, fortune deserted him. The first occupant
of the room his eyes lighted on was Star, while,
oddly enough, Star glanced across at the doorway
at that instant and saw Dud. But that was all there
was to it, for Star removed his gaze without a
flicker of recognition, and Dud went to his own
locker, fortunately the width of the room away from
Star’s, and attended strictly to the matter of making
a hurried change of attire. Some of the fellows
who had learned of the encounter between the two
the afternoon before watched them expectantly until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Star, ready for work, left the building with Weston
and Milford. Dud avoided the glances of the others
as he pulled his togs on. They knew, he was
certain, that he had sworn revenge against Star and
were naturally viewing him disparagingly as a
“quitter.” Had he overheard a whispered conversation
in one corner of the locker-room, however,
he wouldn’t have been troubled so much.</p>

<p>“Did you see Star sneak out?” chuckled Jones, a
rather stout youth with ambitions looking toward
a position in the first team outfield. “I’ll bet
he’s mighty glad faculty read the riot act to
Baker!”</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked Churchill, a third-choice
shortstop.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear? Why, Star and Baker had a
row in here yesterday and went for each other, and
Davy had to separate them. Star was mad because
Baker hit him with the ball when he was at bat.
Baker was wild, they say, and swore he’d get Star
the first chance. So Davy pipes off the faculty and
J. P. beats it to Baker’s room and tells him that if
he doesn’t leave Star alone faculty’ll jump him hard.
So, of course, Baker has to promise to behave, but
they say he’s hopping mad and will get Star yet. I
thought maybe he’d forget and light into him just
now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, peanuts! I guess Star isn’t afraid of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
kid. Why, look at him! Star’s six inches bigger
every way!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” responded Jones, “but they
say Baker’s a regular terror when he gets started.
Got thrown out of one school because he nearly
killed a fellow there.”</p>

<p>“That right?” asked the other incredulously.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know, old scout! Ned Stiles
was telling me. He knows the fellow Baker beat
up.” Jones gazed speculatively and admiringly at
the unconscious Dud and shook his head. “He
doesn’t <em>look</em> awfully scrappy, does he? But, say,
I’ll bet he could hand you an awful wallop with that
right of his! They say he’s as clever as anything on
his feet; just dances all around the other fellow and
does about as he likes. You all ready?”</p>

<p>On the way out Churchill, regarding Dud in surreptitious
awe, encountered that youth’s gaze, and,
as Dud at the instant happened to be frowning
darkly at his thoughts, Churchill was ever after convinced
that Dud was a fellow to be treated with the
utmost respect!</p>

<small>WITH THE SCRUBS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dud speedily forgot all about Star Meyer,
social aspirations and everything else except
baseball, for they had their first practice
game that afternoon and, although Dud wasn’t
called on to work during the first three innings, he
became vastly absorbed in the proceedings. Mr.
Sargent made up one team of seasoned veterans of
previous campaigns, with Gus Weston pitching and
Gordon catching, and formed the opposing team of
the newer candidates, giving the twirling job to
Nate Leddy and letting Ed Brooks catch him. Since
it was the first contest of the year both teams were
on their toes and went into it hard. From the practice
diamond Mr. Crowley’s second nine looked on
enviously when the opportunity allowed.</p>

<p>Weston pitched nice ball for the regulars for two
innings, mowing down the opposing batsmen impartially
and even monotonously. But in the third,
Ben Myatt, playing left field for the scrubs, landed
on one of Gus’s offerings and drove it far into right
center, where neither Star Meyer nor Gordon Parker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
could reach it in time to prevent him from reaching
third. That put the following batsmen on their
mettle, and before the inning was over Gus Weston
had yielded four hits for a total of seven bases and
three runs had crossed the plate. As, however, the
regulars had by that time scored thrice owing to
two singles and as many errors of the scrub’s infield,
the contest was far from decided. Weston managed
to survive the fourth inning, although decidedly
wobbly. He allowed two hits and passed Barnes,
and the scrubs were yelling for a tally when Hugh
Ordway fanned and made the last out, leaving an
irate runner on third.</p>

<p>Brunswick went on the mound for the regulars in
the fifth and Dud took Leddy’s place for the scrub.
After that, as might have been expected, the fielders
were much busier and runs began to trickle across
quite frequently. Dud pitched three innings that
afternoon and performed fairly creditably. Ed
Brooks, fast rounding into form as a catcher, knew
Dud’s failings and jockeyed him along with a lot
of skill and wisdom. More than once Dud found
himself in a hole, and if he escaped, as he generally
did that day, it was more due to Brooks than to him.
The catcher never hesitated to demand the third
strike when it was due, leaving it to Dud to put on
enough steam or to fool the batter with an unexpected
slow ball, and it must be said to Dud’s credit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
that he frequently delivered the goods. But at that
he was hammered hard by the head of the opposing
batting list, and could only find consolation in the
fact that Brunswick fared but little better at the
hands of the scrubs.</p>

<p>Brunswick gave way to Joe Kelly in the eighth,
and in that half-inning the scrubs almost snatched the
game away from their haughty opponents. Kelly
was wild and ineffective and filled the bases with the
first three men up. Jimmy Logan, who had never
set the world on fire with his batting, bunted cannily
down the first-base line, managed to get in the way
of Kelly’s throw to the plate and not only saw two
runners score but reached first in safety himself.
Prentiss fouled out on the second delivery and Jimmy
was caught going down to second. Dud, whose turn
it was at bat, had but slight hope of turning in a hit.
But Kelly had another ascension—or perhaps merely
continued his first!—and got himself in the hole to
the tune of one strike and three balls. Dud let another
strike go by and then hit at the next delivery.
Luck favored him, for Nick Blake, at short, made a
miserable stop of a weak grounder and threw to first
the fraction of a second too late, and the runner
from third was safe. That run brought the scrubs’
score to 11 to the regulars’ 13 and, even with two
down, the scrubs dreamed of tying it up. But Boynton
dispelled the illusion by popping a weak fly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Neil Ayer at first, and, since the practice period was
up, Mr. Sargent called the game. For the succeeding
half-hour the scrubs busied themselves to a man
telling just how they would have won the game had
it gone nine innings!</p>

<p>Doubtless pitching four innings to the tune of nine
hits and two passes isn’t anything remarkable, but
Dud left the field that afternoon treading on air. If,
he confided to himself, he had mixed a few hooks
in with those straight ones and, perhaps, succeeded
in getting a “floater” over nicely a few times, he
would have cut those nine bingles down to three or
four! And, anyway, Pete hadn’t taken him out, as
he had Brunswick, which showed that at least the
coach was fairly satisfied with him. And when,
while he was pulling off his togs, Guy Murtha
stopped an instant to say “Good work, Baker: I
like your style,” the air under Dud’s feet became
roseate clouds! He didn’t even recall Star Meyer’s
existence until, on the way to the showers, he literally
ran into that youth. And then, instead of falling
back, abashed, he pushed past the other with a
fine indifference and rattled the curtain along the rod
in Star’s face!</p>

<p>Afterwards, going across the Green in the early
twilight, he overtook a group of fellows and, contrary
to his usual custom of passing them with a
muttered and doubtful greeting, he fell into step with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Bert Winslow, much to that youth’s surprise, and
carelessly offered an observation to the effect that
it had been a dandy game. Bert agreed unenthusiastically,
shot a curious side-glance at the other,
felt some of his antipathy toward him vanish
and remarked quite cordially: “You’re more of
a pitcher than I thought, Baker. Where’d you
learn it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t learned it yet,” answered Dud, conquering
his shyness with an effort that left him almost
breathless. “Anyway, <em>you</em> didn’t have much
trouble hitting me, Winslow.”</p>

<p>Bert accepted the compliment as merited, which
it was, and thought better of the other’s discernment
and modesty, and while he was beginning a reply
Nick Blake, walking a few steps ahead, turned and
regarded Dud gravely and remarked sadly: “I’ll
give you a quarter next time, Baker, if you’ll tip me
off when you’re going to pitch one of those slow
ones. I don’t mind hitting the air, but I hate to
break my back. Besides, I’m extremely sensitive
to ridicule, Baker.”</p>

<p>The others laughed and Dud was spared the necessity
of a reply by Bert Winslow. “If you were
really sensitive to ridicule, Nick, you wouldn’t try
to play,” he observed crushingly. Nick resented
the insult promptly and battle ensued. Dud left the
adversaries rolling on the turf, applauded by several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
spectators, and made his way on to Trow, feeling
much embarrassed and extremely happy.</p>

<p>The happiness was reflected in the letter which
he wrote home the next afternoon, for that was
Sunday, and Dud, while he sometimes dashed off a
hurried note on a weekday, made it a practice to always
fill four pages with his somewhat scrawly writing
on Sundays. His epistles invariably commenced
the same way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother, Father and Sisters</span> [there were two
of the latter]:</p>

<p>I am well and getting on nicely. I hope you are all well
when this reaches you.</p>
</div>

<p>After that he might change the rest of the contents
from week to week, but Mrs. Baker, who read
the letters aloud to a more or less attentive audience,
could get through the first two sentences while
she was still fixing her reading glasses on her nose.
Today Dud’s letter was far more cheerful than
usual. In fact, it started right out being cheerful,
and the weather, generally dwelt on at length, was
utterly neglected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A good deal has happened since I wrote last and things
are getting pretty busy here. Something doing every minute
in the big tent, like Jimmy says. Yesterday I pitched four
whole innings in the first practice game we have had and did
pretty well take everything in consideration. Dad will say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
I’m boasting but I’m not because if I hadn’t done pretty well
Mr. Sargent would have canned me quick, I guess. They
only got nine hits off me and Guy Murtha who is captain
and a peach of a whanger only got one real hit off me and
one that was mighty scratchy. I guess I did as well as
Brunswick and I know I did better than Joe Kelly because
Joe had an ascension and handed out passes to beat the band.
Well, we’re getting down to business here now all right,
everybody’s doing something, the Track Team has been out
about a fortnight and so have we, nearly, and the tennis
cracks are out on the courts and some of the fellows who
play golf go over to the Mt. Grafton links. They let the
school fellows play there for nothing, but I guess Charley
pays them something for the privilege by the year. I’d like
to try my hand at golf, but I guess it wouldn’t be good for
my pitching. I’m still sticking to straight balls, like I told
you last week, but if I can get my control back pretty soon
I’m going to try hooking them again. I guess you’ll begin
to think I don’t do anything here at School but play baseball,
but that isn’t so because ever since mid-year exams most of
us have been digging like anything. I’m all square again
with Mr. Gring, but I told you that last week. He says
if I could write English as well as I talk it I’d be all right
but just the same I got Good on my last comp and would
have got Excellent only for punctuation. Jimmy says I’m
a punk punctuater. I guess I am, all right, too.</p>

<p>We play our first game the 25th with the second team
and then we play Portsmouth Grammar the 28th. I’ll send
a card with the schedule on it so you will know when we
play and whom. We have sixteen dates this spring but some
of them aren’t filled yet. It’s very hard to get teams around
here to play us because we usually beat them badly and they
don’t like it. I had a row with Starling Meyer in the Field<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
House the other day and he slapped me and Davy, he’s the
trainer, butted in. I was going to make Star fight but faculty
got wise and J. P. came up and said if I did I’d get in
trouble, so I didn’t. But I’ll fix him some other way.
Jimmy is well and as crazy as ever. He is out for the first
too and I guess he will make it, anyway he has more chance
than I have, but I feel very much more encouraged since
Pete let me pitch all through the last of the game yesterday
like I told you. I didn’t get your letter until Friday last
week so I guess dad forgot to post it again. You ask him
if he didn’t. He will say Pooh, Pooh, but I’ll bet anything
he did. I’m getting on fine. I’ve met some more fellows
who are on the nine and everything’s fine and dandy. Please
tell dad that I’d like it if I could have my allowance a little
before the first this month because I have to dig down for
the track team assessment. They voted to tax all of us fifty
cents apiece, which is O.K. only I haven’t got it to spare.
Love to you all,</p>

<p class="noic">Your aff. Son,</p>

<p class="right smcap">Dudley.</p>
</div>

<p>Dud was highly pleased with that letter, for he
discovered that he had bettered his usual four pages
by two more. There was besides, he decided, a
literary flavor to it that most of his epistles lacked;
and he was certain that his father would chuckle
about forgetting to post that letter; and maybe he
would send the allowance right away!</p>

<p>After it was finished he and Jimmy went down to
the Beach and, since they had no canoe of their own
and the punts belonging to the school were hard to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
row and likely to prove leaky, borrowed one of the
many that reposed under the trees along the Cove.
They were in doubt for a while as to which particular
craft to requisition, since it was distinctly advisable
to select one whose owner was not likely to
want it that day. The difficulty was finally solved by
Dud, who recalled the fact that young Twining was
in the infirmary with German measles. Twining
was only a junior, anyway, and juniors had few
rights even when perfectly well, and still fewer when
they weren’t! So Dud blithely led the way to a
gorgeous light blue Old Town, and together they
bore it to the muddy water of the Cove and clambered
in.</p>

<p>“It’s the best canoe here, too,” observed Jimmy
contentedly, as he dipped his paddle at the bow.
(Jimmy took the bow paddle because, or so he declared,
there was more responsibility connected with
that position. Dud, while not deceived in the least,
never objected, for he had a notion that stern paddling
would develop his arm muscles.) “They say
that little bounder has heaps of money, millions and
millions; that is, his dad has. Did I ever tell you
about the old darkey woman who used to work for
us? She was telling mother about some man who
was terribly rich, you know, and mother said, ‘I suspect
he’s a millionaire, Dorah.’ ‘A millionaire, Mis’
Logan!’ says she. ‘Bless yo’ heart, honey, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
man’s got sev’ral millions of airs!’ Guess that’s the
way with Twining’s dad, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s a peach of a canoe that Ordway’s got,”
said Dud, after he had laughed at Jimmy’s story.</p>

<p>“Too fancy,” replied the other as they left the
Cove and headed down the river. “He has about
everything in it except a grand piano!”</p>

<p>“I suppose it cost a lot,” said Dud.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it did. I told him the other day that it
was too pretty to use, and he said he thought it was,
too. Seems he didn’t know much about canoes and
let Bert Winslow order it, and Bert got all the trimmings
the law allows. That’s like Bert. I guess
it’s too heavy to handle well. Here comes Brew
Longley and Foster Tray. Don’t forget to speak
now!”</p>

<p>A battered green canoe occupied by two youths
passed and salutations were exchanged. For once
Dud managed to get just the proper amount of
mixed hauteur and friendliness in his greeting.
Somehow, since yesterday, it wasn’t so hard to do
things like that. Tray, a football player and track
team member, laughed as the canoes passed. “See
you got a canoe now, Jimmy,” he called.</p>

<p>Jimmy waved his paddle nonchalantly. “Yes, it’s
a poor thing but mine own. I’ll let you use it, Tray,
any time you like. I believe in lending to them as
hasn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“You believe in borrowing, too, don’t you?”
laughed Longley.</p>

<p>“Anything but trouble,” responded Jimmy, over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>They paused near the old wooden bridge beyond
the boathouse to watch an automobile dash by at
some forty miles an hour, and Jimmy sighed as he
began to paddle again. “I always think every time
that the old affair will fall into the river, but it never
does. I never do have any luck!” Beyond the
bridge, where the river widened as it wound through
the marshes, they met a canoe at about every turn.
Many were drawn to the bank, and their crews were
usually lying at ease above. About two miles beyond
the bridge and within view of Needham Falls
they overtook a white canoe, or a canoe that had
been white at one time, apparently empty, since at
a little distance nothing showed but an idle paddle
and the backs of the seats.</p>

<p>“That,” mused Dud, “looks like Ordway’s. It
must have got away from him somewhere further
back. We’d better tow it home, hadn’t we?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Got anything we can tie it up with?”
Jimmy altered the direction of his craft to run
alongside the derelict.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can use my belt,” Dud suggested.
But at that moment they came near enough to see
into the white canoe and discovered that it was far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
from empty, since two forms were stretched out flat
on the bottom. One had the colored pages of a
Sunday paper over his face and was consequently
unrecognizable, but the other was unmistakably Nick
Blake himself. Jimmy signaled to stop paddling
and the canoe floated silently alongside.</p>

<p>“Asleep!” whispered Jimmy. Dud nodded.
Their eyes questioned. Here, plainly, was a
Heaven-sent opportunity to perpetrate a joke, but
what form the joke was to take was not easily decided.
Dud watched Jimmy expectantly, and Jimmy
frowned thoughtfully, benignantly down on the recumbent
forms. If, he pondered, there was some
way of fixing a line to the white canoe without waking
the occupants it would be a lark to tow it down
to the Falls and tie it up there in plain sight of the
trolley bridge. But Nick or his companion would
probably wake before they had accomplished that
deed. And, besides, there was no rope handy.
Jimmy was for once at a loss. So, evidently, was
Dud, for the latter returned Jimmy’s inquiring look
blankly. The precious moments passed. And then,
while Jimmy still racked his usually prolific brain,
Nick’s lips opened, although not his eyes, and Nick’s
voice murmured: “Hello, Jimmy! How well
you’re looking. Isn’t he, ’Ighness?”</p>

<p>And from under the newspaper came the reply in
dreamy accents: “Oh, rather! Perfectly ripping!”</p>

<small>ON THE RIVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“You chumps!” growled Jimmy in deep disgust.
“What do you think you’re doing,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“It’s a sad story,” murmured Nick. “We were
shipwrecked six—seven—how many days ago was
it, Mr. Ordway?”</p>

<p>“Seven, Mr. Blake.”</p>

<p>“Ay, seven days ago, sir, and ever since we have
been tossed about in this tiny boat at the mercy of
the sea and tempest and——”</p>

<p>“Elements,” suggested the voice from under the
comic supplement.</p>

<p>“Ay, elephants! At last—at last——”</p>

<p>“Get that in about no food nor water,” prompted
the other in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“I forgot to say that there was no time to provision
the boat. For six days——”</p>

<p>“Seven!”</p>

<p>“For seven days we were without food or drink,
and at last, weak and exhausted, we lay down in the
bottom of the boat and died.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, so you’re dead?” asked Jimmy interestedly.</p>

<p>“Dead as anything,” replied Nick cheerfully.
“You dead, Mr. Ordway?”</p>

<p>“Fearfully, thanks.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. When one is dead one’s memory
is apt to be a bit uncertain, though. That’s why I
asked. Gentleman here inquired. Very kind of him,
I’m sure. Wasn’t it kind of him, ’Ighness?”</p>

<p>“Extraordinarily kind! Most polite, I’m quite
sure!”</p>

<p>“The trouble with you fellows,” said Jimmy solicitously,
“is that you’ve been lying around here in
the sun. What you need is a local application of
cold water to the cranium——”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he talk beautifully, ’Ighness?”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful,” sighed the other.</p>

<p>“And it’s my duty to attend to the matter,” concluded
Jimmy. Nick opened his eyes then and the
colored supplement quivered emotionally.</p>

<p>“Respect the dead, Jimmy,” warned Nick, “or
I’ll forget that I’m a lifeless corpse and lay you out
with a paddle. Who’s there with you?”</p>

<p>“Dud Baker.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the sprightly Baker,” murmured Nick.
“Salutations, Baker.”</p>

<p>“Hello,” replied Dud from the further end of
the canoe. “Hello, Ordway.”</p>

<p>Hugh cast aside the paper and carefully assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
a sitting position. “Hello, Baker,” he said. “Nick,
I fancy we’re rescued.”</p>

<p>“Too late,” answered his companion in disaster
gloomily. “We’re dead. It’s perfectly silly to come
along at this late day and rescue us, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re dead it’s up to us to bury you.
Mind if we don’t sew you up in sacks, Nick? We’re
awfully shy of sacks.”</p>

<p>“I mind terribly. I couldn’t think of being buried
at sea without a sack. I suppose you’ll tell me next
that you haven’t even a cannon ball to sink me with!”</p>

<p>“He might use a couple of those doughnuts,”
suggested Hugh, poking with one foot at a bundle
in the middle of the canoe.</p>

<p>“Doughnuts?” asked Jimmy eagerly. “Got eats
in there, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Nick pulled himself up with a groan.
“We’re off on a picnic, Jimmy. And that reminds
me, Hugh, that it’s about time we looked for a picturesque
sylvan glade somewhere. Seen any of
those things, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy, who had been working the light blue canoe
along until it now rocked companionably beside the
white one, shook his head. “No,” he answered.
“Let’s—er—let’s look at one of those doughnuts,
Nick.”</p>

<p>Nick viewed him speculatively and then dropped
his gaze to the bundle. “I wouldn’t want to expose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
them to the air, Jimmy. They get stale so soon,
you see. But I’ll describe them to you. They’re
big and fat and sort of a lovely golden-brown color,
and they’ve got sugar sprinkled on their circumferences,
so to speak. Honest, Jimmy, they’re awfully
<em>tasty</em> doughnuts. You’d like ’em, I feel sure.”</p>

<p>“Stingy brute! Come across, Nick. I’m as hungry
as a bear. You’ve got plenty, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“Depends,” replied Nick, clasping his hands
about his knees, “what you call plenty. We’ve got
only a dozen.”</p>

<p>“You can have a couple of my six,” laughed
Hugh, reaching for the luncheon.</p>

<p>“One moment,” interposed Nick. “Tell you
what, ’Ighness. Here we are with more food than
we can eat, and here are two famished mariners
miles from port. What’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“Why, we invite them to dinner, of course.”</p>

<p>“Correct! Turn your old tub around, Jimmy,
and paddle back to the willows and we’ll go ashore
and have a banquet. We’ve only got three chops,
but there’s lots of bread and butter and some cheese
and a can of peaches. Only we forgot to bring an
opener, and so I don’t just see—— You don’t happen
to carry a can-opener with you, do you Baker?”</p>

<p>“No, but I think I can-opener without one,” replied
Dud.</p>

<p>“Wow!” said Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>Nick turned with great difficulty and viewed Dud
reproachfully. “You shouldn’t do that,” he said.
“I don’t mind for myself. I’m strong. But Hugh
here won’t get that before tomorrow morning at
eleven-thirty-nine, and meanwhile he will puzzle
that poor English bean of his and get faint and
dizzy. You shouldn’t, Baker, you shouldn’t!”</p>

<p>“Get what?” asked Hugh innocently.</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed and Nick nodded sorrowfully at
him. “Listen, ’Ighness,” he explained patiently.
“It was like this. I asked Baker if he carried a can-opener
with him. Get that?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. And he said he could open it without
one. What’s the joke?”</p>

<p>Nick cast his hands aside hopelessly. “What’s
the use? What’s the use?” he demanded. “Come
on and let’s paddle. I’m sta-a-arved!”</p>

<p>“How about getting back for supper?” inquired
Jimmy. “It’s ’way after five now.”</p>

<p>“We get lost or we have an upset or something,”
rejoined Nick carelessly. “We discussed that, but
I forget now just what we decided.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right for you,” objected Jimmy as he
and Dud swung their craft around, “but what about
us? We can’t all get upset?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Nick, reaching for his paddle.
“There’s plenty of water, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“But, I say, Nick,” remonstrated Hugh, “if we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
tell them we were upset we’ll have to get our clothes
wet, eh?”</p>

<p>“Um, that’s so. I hadn’t thought of that. Oh,
well, never mind now. We’ll think up something
going back.”</p>

<p>“We might let the canoes get away from us and
have to chase them,” suggested Dud.</p>

<p>“Perfect!” applauded Nick. “Baker, you have
a great mind. Tell you what, my hearties. After
we get to the willows we’ll carelessly let the canoes
get away, see? Then we’ll catch ’em further downstream.
They won’t ask us how <em>far</em> we had to chase
’em. Even if they do we can be vague.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better try to get back on time,”
said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Squealer!” Nick, in the stern, reproachfully
splashed Hugh’s back. “There’s no fun picnicking
if you have to go home right away and eat another
meal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, old chap,” agreed Hugh. “Only
don’t throw any more water down my neck. It’s
beastly cold.”</p>

<p>There was silence then for a few minutes while
the two canoes passed leisurely down the winding
stream, side by side. Westward, the sun was dropping
close to the greening summit of the low hills
and the April day was almost at its end. There
was a perceptible chill in the little breeze that crept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
across the meadows and made catspaws on the quiet
surface of the water. Early blackbirds were fluttering
along the banks ahead of the canoes, uttering
their creaky notes and simulating wild alarm. A
fish leaped after a reckless insect and fell back with
a startling splash, sending widening circles away in
the amber glow. They didn’t paddle much, for
there was enough current to bear them along.
Jimmy frankly shipped his blade and watched the
drops trickle. Nick’s voice came across the few
yards of water.</p>

<p>“Somebody will please say some poetry,” he requested.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower</div>

  </div>

<p>“That’ll be about all of that,” interrupted Nick.
“If you don’t know anything cheerful, ’Ighness, dry
up. ‘The moping owl’! Where do you get that
stuff, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Chap name of Gray wrote it,” replied Hugh
meekly.</p>

<p>“Thought so! Same fellow who did that ‘Elegy
on a Country Cemetery,’ or whatever it is. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
a jovial old Johnnie, wasn’t he? Bet you he’d have
been swell company at a funeral!”</p>

<p>“If you want something bright and sparkling,”
offered Jimmy, “I know a nice little poem about a
hanging! It begins——”</p>

<p>“Never mind how it begins! Want to spoil a
perfectly good appetite? I say, you fellows, we’ll
race you to the willows. Dig, ’Ighness!”</p>

<p>Followed a spirited race around the last bend to
where a group of willows leaned out over the shadowed
water. Victory was claimed by both crews,
and the matter was never finally settled, for Nick
tactfully introduced the subject of supper in the middle
of the argument and leaped ashore with the
brown-paper package that contained the precious
viands. Dried marsh grass and the paper from the
bundle started a fire at the foot of one gnarled willow,
and small pieces of driftwood, deposited by
some winter flood, were piled on. Meanwhile Hugh
made the discovery that they had failed to provide
salt for the chops and that Nick had neglected to
bring his folding cup. Jimmy helpfully reminded
them that it was an ancient custom, or so he had
read, to substitute gunpowder for salt when the latter
was not to be had, and so <em>that</em> was all right!
Nick called him an idiot and borrowed his knife to
sharpen a stick on which to broil the chops. In
payment Jimmy helped himself to a doughnut.</p>

<small>CONFESSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A quarter of an hour later they were sitting
around the bed of glowing coals busily
concerned with the chops and bread and
butter. The chops were decidedly underdone in the
middle although beautifully crisp outside, and Nick
came in for some criticism as a cook. But each of
the four ate his share—it had proved rather a problem
to divide three chops into four equal portions!—and
so, if the proof of “the pudding is in the eating,”
Nick was vindicated. They had also brought
four potatoes to roast, but it was decided that life
was too short and appetites too impatient to wait for
them, and so Jimmy buried them in the ground,
after carefully cutting them into quarters, and agreed
to share the proceeds of the crop in September with
the others, estimating the yield at two pecks. When
they were thirsty they went down the bank, climbed
into a canoe and leaned their heads into the river,
thus, as Nick pointed out, getting not only a drink
but a bath.</p>

<p>The doughnuts, now diminished to eleven, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
served out as dessert, Jimmy, of course, receiving
only two as his share, and were consumed with the
peaches and cheese. Jimmy’s knife was rather the
worse for its encounter with the can, but Dud kept
his promise of opening the latter. They speared
the peaches out with slivers, passing the can around
the circle until nothing was left but the juice. Then
they drank that. Afterwards they tossed the can
into the river and threw pebbles at it until it floated
slowly out of range. By that time it was fully twilight
and the April evening was growing chill. So
they built up the fire again and sat closer, huddling
together for better protection from the little breeze
that whispered through the dead grass and leafless
boughs. For a while no one showed much inclination
for conversation, but after a while Hugh let
fall a murmured remark and presently they were
talking desultorily of this and that, or, at least,
Jimmy and Hugh and Nick were. Dud, as usual,
had little to say, and finally Nick remarked:</p>

<p>“Shut up, Baker, and let someone else get a word
in. I never heard such a chatterbox.”</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled. “Isn’t he gabby?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Is he like this in the room, Jimmy?” Nick inquired.</p>

<p>“N-no, and that’s the funny part of it. When he
and I are alone together he’s just full of words;
can’t get them out fast enough. In company, though,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
he’s horribly otherwise. I’ve been trying to break
him of it, but”—Jimmy sighed lugubriously—“nothing
doing.”</p>

<p>“I dare say he believes in waiting until he has
something to say,” offered Hugh. “Is that the idea,
Baker?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know.” Dud laughed uncertainly.
“I never seem to think of things when—when I’m
around with a crowd.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t call us a crowd, do you?” demanded
Nick. “Come on now; loosen up; spring
some of those scintillant remarks that Jimmy is always
repeating. Know what he does, Baker? Well,
he tells ’em around and sort of gets the credit for
’em himself. Of course, he says you said them, but
there’s a sort of—of inflection in his voice that gives
you the idea that he put you up to it or—or something;
if you know what I mean, as Hugh would
say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dud’s full of bright things,” said Jimmy
carelessly. “Only the trouble is he doesn’t talk for
publication.”</p>

<p>“And you’re his press agent, eh?” laughed Nick.
“I’ve often wondered——” He stopped. Then he
laughed softly and Jimmy was aware that he was regarding
him mirthfully in the half darkness.</p>

<p>“What’s the bally joke?” murmured Hugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. That is——” Nick fell into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
silence again. Then: “Most of the things Jimmy
tells sound a whole lot like Jimmy,” he stated suggestively.
There was a moment’s silence, broken
at last by Dud.</p>

<p>“They are Jimmy’s,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Here, don’t try to put the blame on me!” Jimmy
laughed loudly. “That’s a punk trick, Dud!”</p>

<p>“Honest confession is good for the soul,” said
Nick lightly. “Come across, Jimmy. What’s the
idea? Everyone knows you’ve been touting Baker
like anything ever since Christmas recess. What is
it, a conspiracy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy laid a twig carefully on the fire. “I don’t
know what you’re talking about,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do, old man! We’re all friends
together, you know, and nothing you say will be
used against you. That all right, Baker?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask him,” replied Jimmy. “He’d tell you
anything. He’s incapable of the truth. Say, what’s
the matter with getting back, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s plenty of time,” said Nick. “Joking
aside, Jimmy, just what is the big idea?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and tell,” urged Dud. “I don’t mind.
Besides, they won’t talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you!” said Jimmy in disgust. “What is
there to tell? Well, all right, fellows. Only this is
just between us, understand? It’s a little scheme of
my own. You see, Dud here is—well, he’s just as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
you see him now. He thinks big thoughts and he’s a
nice boy, but he’s a graven image when he gets outside
his room. Well, he likes fun as much as the rest
of us but he doesn’t get it because he always thinks
he isn’t wanted around. He—he’s shy, you know.
At least, I suppose that’s it. I never was that way
and don’t know much about it.”</p>

<p>Nick and Hugh laughed.</p>

<p>“So I said one day: ‘Dud,’ I said, ‘you do like I
tell you and I’ll have you mixing in no time at all.
I’ll make a regular feller of you, and it won’t cost
you a cent. All you’ve got to do is what I tell you.’
So Dud said: ‘Oh, pshaw!’ or words to that effect,
but agreed to try the scheme. First thing I did was
to make a list of fellows he ought to know. Then
we started in and got acquainted. It was hard sledding
because just as soon as I got him into a bunch
of fellows he’d get tongue-tied. Well, I saw that
that wouldn’t do and so I began to get off the good
things Dud said——”</p>

<p>“All of which you made up?” chuckled Nick.</p>

<p>“No, not all, honest. Some I did, of course. Dud
didn’t deliver the goods fast enough. And—well,
that’s all there is to it. Perfectly legitimate, you
see, although Dud has had his doubts now and then
and threatened mutiny once or twice. We’ve got on
fairly well. I haven’t exactly popularized him yet,
but I haven’t done so badly either. Lately he’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
been sort of kicking over the traces and refusing to
pull, but we’re progressing slowly. Now you know
all about it. If either of you chaps blab I’ll punch
your head.”</p>

<p>“So that’s it,” mused Nick. “Some scheme, eh,
’Ighness?”</p>

<p>“Rather!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you know,” said Dud, embarrassed,
“because it’s always seemed so silly for Jimmy to
go around getting off a lot of funny jokes and crediting
them to me, and then—then for me to just
stand around and act like a dummy. I suppose we
went into it as a sort of lark, or—well, I don’t
know. I suppose it sounds funny to you chaps. But
I wanted you to know.”</p>

<p>“I knew already,” said Hugh. “That is, I guessed
a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” exclaimed Jimmy. “Say, that’s queer,
because when I asked Dud which of the fellows he’d
like to——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Jimmy!” implored Dud.</p>

<p>“Why? There’s no harm in it, you chump. I
asked Dud who he’d like to know most and he
said——”</p>

<p>“<em>Please</em> dry up, Jimmy!”</p>

<p>“He said Hugh Ordway. That’s why we butted
in on you one night a long while ago.”</p>

<p>“Really? Well, you know, that’s quite a compliment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Baker. I’m afraid, though, you didn’t find
me—what’s the word, Nick?”</p>

<p>“Responsive?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. Or appreciative, I guess; that’s better.
If I’d known——”</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect Baker to tell you, did you?”
asked Nick. “If you really wanted to know a fine,
respectable member of the community, though,
Baker, why didn’t you select me? I can’t understand
you wanting to know this cold-blooded Britisher.”</p>

<p>“I think we called on you next,” answered Dud,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Did you? Well, thanks for small favors! But
look here, Jimmy, it’s been fun for you, I guess, but
you haven’t done Baker much good, you idiot! A
fellow’s got to work out his own—his own salvation
at school. No one else can do it for him. Now
you let Baker hoe his own row, and——”</p>

<p>“That’s all you know about it,” replied Jimmy
tranquilly. “Dud is on speaking terms with about
every fellow worth knowing now and before I took
him in hand——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, but I’d rather have a half-dozen
real friends than be able to say ‘Hello’ to
everyone. All Baker needs is to put his chin up and—and
get out and—and mix!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” agreed Jimmy sarcastically. “That’s all!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
But suppose he can’t do it? Suppose he hasn’t got
the—the assurance? Then what? Why, that’s
where I come in, do you see?”</p>

<p>“You’re an ass,” laughed Nick. “Baker, you
take my advice and discharge your press agent.
He’s no good. Anyway, you won’t need him any
more.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny about being popular, or whatever you
like to call it,” mused Hugh. “Funny, I mean, how
some fellows are and some aren’t; and lots of times
the popular chaps aren’t the ones you like best, if
you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Very clear, ’Ighness; almost pellucid,” said Nick.
“Just the same——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever wanted to be what you’d
call popular,” interrupted Dud. “I never could be,
I’m sure. All I did want was to know more fellows
and not feel quite so much out of everything. Of
course, being a lower middler I dare say it’s cheeky
to want to mix with fellows in the upper classes——”</p>

<p>“Don’t see it that way,” said Nick. “Very commendable
ambition, I’d call it. Shows a desire to
seek—er—refinement and wisdom, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s get back,” said Jimmy. “I’m freezing
to death. Besides, you chaps may say what you like,
but I know that without my skillful handling of the
case Dud wouldn’t be sitting here tonight listening
to you talk a lot of poppycock, Nick. Results are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
what count, and as a—a press agent, if you like, I’ve
produced results. Now someone tell me I haven’t!”</p>

<p>“If you call this a result,” began Nick doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course I do! Dud has shown you two chaps
that, whether he’s a brilliant conversationalist or
isn’t, he’s a perfectly human sort of a chump, and
you both like him a little better than you did yesterday,
and tomorrow Dud can go around and mention
to a few fellows that last evening he picnicked
with Ordway and Blake on the river, and the fellows
will think, ‘Now if Baker is in with Ordway and
Nick Blake he must be all right,’ and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a rotter, Jimmy!” begged Dud.</p>

<p>“Rotter nothing! It’s so, isn’t it? Mind, I don’t
say you will tell about it, but you could. You
won’t, as a matter of fact, because you don’t play
the game for all it’s worth.”</p>

<p>“Honest, Jimmy, you’re enough to sicken a fellow,”
said Nick. “If I thought you believed what
you preached, or practiced it——”</p>

<p>“I do,” insisted Jimmy stoutly.</p>

<p>“You don’t,” contradicted Dud. “Come on home
before you talk any more nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I deny the nonsense,” replied Jimmy good-naturedly,
“but I’m perfectly willing to go home. I’ve
been trying to for half an hour. Help me up, someone.
My legs are stiff with the cold. I say, we
mustn’t forget to let the canoes get adrift, fellows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, rot,” said Hugh. “If we’ve got to lie, let’s
lie decently.”</p>

<p>“Why lie at all, then?” asked Dud. “Let’s just
say that we wanted to have supper on the river, and—and
had it!”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” applauded Nick. “Who knows
but that we’ll get off easy that way? Faculty will
be so surprised when we don’t offer any of the usual
excuses that they’ll probably forget to put us on
pro. Anyway, let’s try it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try anything once,” murmured Jimmy, as he
stretched his numbed legs. “I wonder, though, if
we can see our way back? Bet you we’ll run into
the bank every two minutes! Where the dickens is
that canoe? I thought we left it right here. And
where’s——” Jimmy stopped and turned toward
the others approaching. “Say, fellows, I know an
awfully good joke,” he drawled.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Nick suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Get ready to laugh. All set? Well, <a href="#i_fp144">the canoes
have gone!</a>”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“Gone!” exclaimed Hugh. “My word! But
how——”</p>

<p>“Cut out the comedy, Jimmy,” said Nick.
“Aren’t they there, really?”</p>

<p>“Well, you come and have a look. Maybe your
sight is better than mine. I haven’t my glasses with
me and so, of course, I may be mistaken, but nevertheless
and notwithstanding——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be switched!” muttered Nick, holding
a flaring match aloft in the darkness. “Now how
the dickens——”</p>

<p>“I guess,” offered Dud, “that getting in and out
of them to drink pushed them off.”</p>

<p>“That’s the jolly story,” agreed Hugh. “But
they were there the last time I went down.”</p>

<p>“Who took the last drink?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“You did, didn’t you? Did you see both canoes
then?”</p>

<p>Jimmy turned to Nick in the gloom and considered.
At last: “I didn’t notice,” he confessed.
“It was pretty dark then——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“But I say,” interrupted Hugh, “what are we
going to do, eh?”</p>

<p>“Beat it home, ’Ighness,” responded Nick, “if
you know what I mean. There’s no use looking for
the pesky things tonight. I dare say, anyway, they’ll
run aground somewhere before they get very far.
What we’ve got to do is foot it back. How far is
it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“About a mile and a half,” answered Jimmy
gloomily, “and most of the way across this plaguey
marsh. Unless we strike across that direction and
find the Yarrow road.”</p>

<p>“That would be worse than looking for the
canoes,” said Nick. “Best thing to do is follow
the river as well as we can. Come on!”</p>

<p>“I say, if I fall in you might sing out so I’ll know
which way to swim,” suggested Hugh. “Tomorrow
I’m going to buy an anchor for that canoe, Nick;
that is, if I ever find it.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” muttered Jimmy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“I was just recalling the interesting fact that the
canoe we were in belongs to young Twining, the little
beast, and he will be likely to be quite peevish if
it’s lost.”</p>

<p>“How inconsiderate!” laughed Nick. “He’s a
junior, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“That’s all right then. You can point out to him
that it’s a great honor for him to have his canoe lost
by an upper middler. Besides, it’ll turn up in the
morning. Oh, thunder!”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” agreed Hugh, scrambling out
of the ditch he had followed Nick into. “’Ware
water, fellows!”</p>

<p>Dud and Jimmy escaped that time, but during the
next half-hour or so they had their share of misfortunes.
There was no moon and the stars were partly
hidden by light clouds and it was impossible to see
more than a pace ahead at any time. They never
actually tumbled into the river, but they frequently
stumbled down the bank and only saved themselves
by prompt laying hold of whatever they could reach,
as when Nick, walking too close to the edge and
finding himself slipping, promptly clutched Hugh’s
leg and nearly doubled the catastrophe! It seemed
more like an hour than a half-hour since they had
left the willows before they caught sight of the old
bridge looming indistinctly above them. After that
the rest was easy, for they had only to break their
way through the bushes that clad the embankment
and foot it along Crumbie Street to the corner of the
campus, their path now illumined by the infrequent
street lights. Under the first of them they stopped
to take stock. Every one of them was wet to the
knees or above and plastered here and there with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the nice, dark, rich mud of the marshes. It was almost
eight o’clock and any hope they may have entertained
of reaching their various rooms undetected
had long since vanished. Nick sighed philosophically
as he turned to continue his journey, his shoes
<em>squish-squashing</em> at every step.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he said, “when we tell them we lost
the canoes and had to walk home they’ll just have
to believe us! That is the one bright spot in the surrounding
gloom.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always wondered,” mused Jimmy, “how it
would feel to be on probation.”</p>

<p>“You ought to know by this time,” chuckled Dud.
“You’ve been there twice already.” For some reason,
Dud seemed less troubled by the impending disaster
than the others.</p>

<p>Jimmy sniffed. “I don’t know, Mr. Baker, where
you get your information, but you have been sadly
misled. The other occasions to which you doubtless
allude——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Jimmy,” warned Nick. “And, say,
we’d better part company about now. You and
Baker beat it up here and Hugh and I’ll amble
careless-like over to River Street. I hate to
attract attention, I’m that modest. Nighty-night!”</p>

<p>“Same to you,” replied Jimmy. “And thanks for
a pleasant party. Although I must say that your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
arrangements for getting us home were a bit—ah—primitive!”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it! Farewell, brothers. We
meet in prison!”</p>

<p>Whether by design or accident, Mr. Russell’s
study door was wide open as Dud and Jimmy
quietly slipped from the stairway well into the
first-floor corridor of Trow, and, although they
didn’t think it advisable to stop to pass the time
of day with the instructor, they stopped just the
same.</p>

<p>“Ah, Logan, is that you?” It was “J. P.’s” voice.
The two boys retraced their steps and halted at the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Jimmy brightly.</p>

<p>“And Baker, too, I see. Well, young gentlemen,
where have you been? We missed your bright
and smiling faces at supper tonight.”</p>

<p>Mr. Russell seemed to be in a pleasant mood,
though one couldn’t always be certain from appearances,
and so Jimmy, as spokesman, smiled his most
winning smile and answered truthfully: “In the
mud, sir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Yes, I see. All the evidence tends to
corroborate your quaint statement. But why in the
mud, Logan?”</p>

<p>Jimmy hesitated an instant and then decided to
make a clean breast of the matter. Mr. Russell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
heard him through, smiling pleasantly. And when
the tale was told he said: “A most interesting
narrative, Logan, on my word. You show a nice
sense of dramatic construction. But really, boys,
I’m rather afraid trouble will come of this. You
know there’s a rule about being in bounds by six
o’clock on Sundays, eh? By the way, you brought
your fellow miscreants back with you, I trust? I
refer to Ordway and Blake.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; they’re back,” replied Jimmy dispiritedly.
Mr. Russell’s tone now wasn’t so reassuring.</p>

<p>“And they, too, were—ah—in the mud?”</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned. “You’d think so if you saw
them! They fell right in a ditch once!”</p>

<p>“Really?” Mr. Russell smiled quite broadly.
“Well, I suppose it’s all a grand lark with you
youngsters, eh? Dear, dear, what a thing it is to
be young! Get those wet things off, boys, and stay
in your room for the rest of the evening. Possibly——”
He caught himself up. Then: “We’ll
hope for the best. Hm! Better look to your ways
for awhile, though, both of you. How about that
little matter we spoke of recently, Baker? Any—ah—any
developments?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I—I quit.”</p>

<p>“Wise youth! Go your ways, young gentlemen.
Ponder on your sins and”—Mr. Russell took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
up his book again—“refresh your souls with the
sweet communion——”</p>

<p>The rest was only a mumble. Dud and Jimmy
stole noiselessly away.</p>

<p>Fortune was good to them on the morrow. They
were assembled, a sober quartette, in Dr. Duncan’s
office after breakfast and gravely reprimanded and
told that only a diligent application to studies could
wipe out the stain of their guilt. Promises of unfaltering
labor being at once forthcoming from each,
they were dismissed with a final admonition to mend
their ways and, they thought, a sigh of relief from
the principal, never at his best in the rôle of Stern
Authority.</p>

<p>After a ten o’clock recitation, Nick and Jimmy
hurried up the river in Nick’s canoe and recovered
the lost craft, Twining’s being found lodged against
the bridge timbers and Hugh’s a half-mile up the
stream, entangled in a sunken branch. That, to
all appearances, ended the affair, but in reality
there was one important consequence that was lost
sight of, which was the acceptance of Dud into the
circle in which Nick Blake and Hugh Ordway revolved.
It didn’t happen all at once, and for a
week or two Dud himself didn’t realize it, but at
the end of that period he suddenly discovered himself
sitting with Hugh and Nick and Bert Winslow
and Ted Trafford in Nick’s room very gravely discussing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
such important subjects as The Value of the
Sacrifice Hit, Overhand versus Underhand Pitching,
When to Use the Pinch-Play and The Duties
of a Third-Baseman on a Bunt to His Territory
with a Man on Second. Perhaps Dud didn’t take
a very large part in the discussion, but when he had
anything to say he found voice to say it, and a few
remarks from him on the subject of underhand
pitching were well received. But the main thing
was that he was there, not on sufferance but, as it
seemed, quite naturally and as a matter of course.
He surreptitiously pinched himself, found he was
actually awake and then, for a moment, was visibly
embarrassed.</p>

<p>I don’t pretend that either Hugh or Nick would
have been broken-hearted if Dud hadn’t been present
that evening, nor shall I attempt to guess just
how much of the friendliness they displayed was
due to sympathy. On the other hand, they were
more than willing to have him there, and, when
they thought of it, were at some pains to make him
feel welcome. Ted Trafford took his cue from his
host, and Bert Winslow’s attitude was one of careless
toleration. He still looked on Dud with suspicion.
Jimmy Logan couldn’t foist any lemon on
him, as he once eloquently put it to Hugh! Still,
he didn’t actually dislike the younger boy, and, save
for an occasional mildly sarcastic comment occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
by what he called Dud’s cheek in trying to
squirm his way into upper class company and the
first team, he treated the latter decently enough.
The evening ended with ginger-ale and grape-juice,
mixed in equal proportions in a pitcher, the scant
remains of a pineapple cheese and some crackers.
Ted Trafford and Dud went back to Trow together,
rather silently since Ted was sleepy and Dud had
nothing important to say, and parted in the corridor.
Dud reflected afterwards that Trafford might
have said, “Come and see me some time, Baker,”
or something to like effect. But he didn’t. He
merely nodded sleepily, yawned and murmured:
“Night!” Dud was a bit disappointed, and without
cause. Ted Trafford, who was a big, good-hearted
senior, would have issued that invitation had
it occurred to him that the younger boy would have
set any store by it. As it was, the thought didn’t
enter his mind. If Baker was a friend of Nick and
Hugh, why, that was all there was to it. “Any
friend of my friend,” is the way Ted would have
put it.</p>

<p>Followed a week bare of real incident. Dud, like
the other members of that picnic party, applied himself
doggedly to his lessons in an effort to get square
with the Office again and turned out each week-day
afternoon for baseball practice. Sometimes he
pitched for the scrubs and more often his work consisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
of serving them up to the batters at the net
and, afterwards, being relieved by Kelly or Brunswick,
practicing batting himself. The first game of
the season came off that Wednesday afternoon, with
the second team as the opponent. It wasn’t much
of a contest. Errors swelled the score of each team
and all sorts of delays slowed the game up so that
there was time for only seven innings. Dud took
no part, the twirling being performed by Ben Myatt
for three innings and by Nate Leddy for the rest of
the game. The second team pitchers were severely
handled and the first won by the decisive score of
17 to 7.</p>

<p>If there was any special sensation in that contest
it was in the sudden eminence of “Hobo” Ordway
as a batter. Hugh, going into the line-up in the
fourth inning, came twice to bat and on each occasion
smashed a long, clean two-bagger into left-center.
In the field he had only three chances, but
he took them all. It was only in throwing in that
Hugh was weak. Jimmy went to right field for
three innings, made one rather brilliant running
catch of a long fly, failed to get a hit and retired
in favor of a pinch hitter in the sixth. After that
Wednesday game life settled down again rather
monotonously, but not uninterestingly, for Dud. On
Saturday the team journeyed away and played Portsmouth
Grammar School and won handily against a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
weak adversary. Dud didn’t accompany the team as
a member nor did he go along with the half-hundred
ardent rooters. Neither did Jimmy. Mr.
Russell in refusing their request for leave, intimated
that the afternoon might be spent far more profitably
in study. “J. P.” was kindly but firm. Doubtless
his advice was well-meant and worthy of consideration,
but I regret to say it was not followed.
Instead, the two boys went trout fishing in Three
Gallon Brook, a mile back of school. Dud used
flies and got not even a nibble. Jimmy, with a plentiful
supply of angle-worms, landed a four-inch sunfish.
As no one, so far as they were aware, had
ever caught, seen or suspected the presence of a
trout in Three Gallon Brook, they were not disappointed.
The only feature of the excursion not
counted on occurred when Dud slipped from a rock
during the effort to free his line from a snag and
landed in three feet of extremely cold water. Fortunately
that happened after Jimmy had landed
his catch and so they were about ready to go home,
anyway. Jimmy carried the sunfish back to school
dangling from an alder branch. That is, it dangled
until they reached the school grounds. Then it was
placed tenderly in Jimmy’s coat pocket and smuggled
to Number 19. When he returned from supper
he brought salt, and the fish was fried over the
gas—with the door and transom carefully closed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
and both windows wide open—and consumed in a
peculiarly flabby and underdone condition. Jimmy
partook with gusto, or pretended to, but Dud did
scant justice to the repast. Jimmy said he was jealous.
Gus Weston happened in before the penetrating
aroma of the sunfish had been entirely dissipated
and asked anxiously what the trouble was. Whereupon
Jimmy stopped trying to dislodge a bone that
had worked its way in back of his tongue and described
movingly the size, ferocious aspect and fighting
qualities of that fish, recounting with much detail
the long, exhausting struggle incident to its capture.
And Weston diplomatically vowed that he believed
every word of it; and had either of them a rattling
good detective story to lend him?</p>

<small>DUD SERVES THEM UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Between Dud and Starling Meyer existed
an armed neutrality. They passed with covert
glances, avoided each other when possible
and doubtless caused some disappointment to a
certain element in the school who had been for
several weeks eagerly expecting a fracas between
the two. The boxing lessons had been abandoned,
since, as Jimmy pathetically pointed out, there was
no use getting ready for something that couldn’t
happen. The gloves were returned to their owners,
and, robbed of self-defense as a principal interest in
life, Jimmy gave his attention to playing baseball.
It occurred to him at about this time that it wouldn’t
look well for Dud to make the first team, even as a
substitute, and for him to get chucked back to the
second nine. So the Monday after the Portsmouth
Grammar School game Jimmy buckled down to
make good. Right field seemed the only position
open to him, and even to earn that he would have
to beat out Harold Boynton, and Boynton, while
not an exceptional fielder, was a pretty fair hitter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Therefore it behooved Jimmy to get busy and learn
to “lam ’em out” a bit better. His first step was to
attempt to bribe Brunswick and Dud to pitch easy
ones when he was at the net. Failing at that, he
sighed and set out to conquer by labor. Jimmy always
preferred to take short cuts. The longest
way around might suit some fellows, but he took
it only as a last resort. Having, however, made up
his mind to the circuitous journey, Jimmy was
capable of settling down to the task and seeing it
through.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the second team was again defeated,
and on the following Saturday Grafton High
School, supported by a large and noisy mob of pennant-flaunting
boys and girls, engaged the attention
of the first team. The batting order that afternoon
gave a line on what was likely to be the final selections:
Blake, ss; Murtha, 2b; Parker, cf; Winslow,
3b; Ayer, 1b; Ordway, lf; Boynton, rf; Gordon, c;
Myatt or Leddy, p. There might be, probably
would be, changes later on in the arrangement of
the players for batting purposes, but it was generally
conceded that the team as made up that day
was practically as it would be six weeks later. It
was likely that Ben Myatt would occasionally be
played in center field, for Ben, aside from being a
remarkable pitcher, was a steady outfielder and a
good hitter. There were some critics who sneered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
at Hugh Ordway’s presence on the nine, hinting
at favoritism, and it must be acknowledged that
Hugh accomplished little that afternoon to vindicate
his selection for the middle-garden position. Hugh
had a bad day, missing one easy fly and failing to
reach first base once. His muff in the third inning
let in two runs and made the outcome doubtful
until the sixth, when a single by Guy Murtha
with one down, a sacrifice by Parker, a screeching
two-base hit by Bert Winslow and an error by
third-baseman landed two tallies for the home
team.</p>

<p>The score stayed at five to five until the ninth,
when the home team started a rally. Bert Winslow,
first man up, was passed. Neil Ayer laid a bunt in
front of the plate, sending Bert to second and going
out himself at first. Mr. Sargent sent Milford to
bat in place of Hugh and Milford came through
with a clean single that landed him on first. Bert,
however, was out at the plate by inches only. With
two gone, a second pinch-hitter was sent to the rescue
in the person of Gus Weston. As a pinch-hitter
Gus was ordinarily something of a joke, but on this
occasion he turned the laugh on High School’s
pitcher, landing on the first offering and sending it
down the third-base line for a hit that advanced
Milford to second. Gordon followed with a pop-fly
that should have been an easy out, but which second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
baseman and shortstop managed between them to
let fall safe.</p>

<p>With bases full and Nate Leddy up—Myatt had
gone through five innings and been sent to the
showers—Mr. Sargent took a chance and let Nate
go to bat. Evidently the latter was instructed to
wait out the pitcher, for he stood idly by while two
strikes and two balls went across. Then the coach
called him back and Jimmy Logan was sent in to
distinguish himself. Anyone but Jimmy would have
suffered from nerves, I fancy, for it is something
of an ordeal to step up to the plate with two out,
bases filled and the pitcher’s score two-and-two.
But Jimmy approached the task with beautiful assurance.
Some said he even swaggered a little.
Perhaps he did, and perhaps that swagger was the
undoing of the opposing pitcher. At any rate, all
Jimmy had to do was dodge two wild deliveries and
trot, smilingly, to first, while Milford ambled over
the plate with what proved eventually to be the winning
run. Nick Blake brought the inning to an
end a moment later when he sent a long fly to the
outfield.</p>

<p>Grafton High School begrudged that victory and
showed it, at the time by the half-hearted way in
which they cheered their successful rival, and later
by sending a challenge for another contest on High
School grounds. The challenge was accepted and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
vacant date a week and a half later was awarded
her. Since faculty rules prohibited the team from
playing away from the school on Wednesdays during
April and May, a special dispensation was asked
for and obtained, and the game came off in due time
and High School went down in decisive defeat, the
score at the end of the seven innings played being
9 to 2 in favor of Grafton.</p>

<p>Before that, however, Leeds High School had
administered the first beating to the Scarlet-and-Gray
to the tune of 3 to 0. It was a good game and
Grafton showed up well in all departments except
that of hitting. Leeds’ pitcher was a hard proposition
and only four scattered hits were registered
by Grafton. On the other hand, Leddy, who started
in the box for his team, was found for six hits in
four innings, one of them a three-bagger, and although
Ben Myatt, who relieved him, held the enemy
well in hand, the mischief was already done.
In the eighth and ninth innings that day Mr. Sargent
used every available player in his determined
effort to stem the tide of disaster, even Dud getting
a chance to show his batting prowess and rapping
a liner straight into the hands of shortstop as his
contribution to the cause. Jimmy, called into the
fray in the eighth, managed to get hit with an in-shoot
and so, luckily, earned his base. It was Starling
Meyer who came nearest to accomplishing anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
in the batting line, for Star, after watching
two good ones pass him, landed on what was palpably
intended for a wide one and managed to drop
it behind first base some three inches inside the
foul line. Unfortunately there was no one on the
bases to take advantage of the miracle.</p>

<p>As a result of the Leeds game there followed, beginning
on the next Monday afternoon, a series of
batting practices that for the rest of the week, barring
Wednesday and Saturday, left no time for line-ups.
There also followed a change in the batting
order and a slight shakeup of the team. Bert Winslow
took Guy Murtha’s place as second batter, Guy
following him and Parker slipping into fourth position.
Gordon and Boynton also changed locations.
Milford was tried out at first and for the next three
weeks he and Neil Ayer had a very lively struggle
for the first sack. Eventually Ayer came into his
own again, although had batting ability alone entered
into it Milford would undoubtedly have won
the place. Jimmy got several opportunities to show
what he could do in right field and Starling Meyer
received some recognition in center. Southlake Academy
was defeated on the nineteenth at Southlake,
Gus Weston pitching for once a remarkably steady
game until he was taken out in the seventh. By that
time the contest was on ice and Coach Sargent sent
Brunswick in for a couple of innings of experience.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
Experience came his way, too, to the tune of four
hits for a total of six bases, but luckily only one run
resulted.</p>

<p>Track and field sports were by now engaging
much of the school’s interest. The team had held
its handicap games the last of April, had defeated
St. James Academy the week before and was at
present very busily at work getting into condition
to meet Mount Morris, Grafton’s principal rival,
on the twenty-sixth. Over on the big oval ribbon
of gray-blue cinders the twenty-odd youths who wore
the scarlet-and-gray stripe across their chests or who
hoped to wear it after next Saturday, sprinted and
ran and hurdled, while about the jumping pits a
dozen or fifteen others strove mightily with shot
and hammer and vaulting-pole or worked zealously
at the jumps. Nowadays the audience at the first
team diamond was smaller each afternoon, and one
heard much learned talk of dual records, and the
names of Zanetti and Tray and Keyes and Yetter
and Musgrave and many others pursued one from
breakfast to bedtime. “Dinny” Crowley divided
his time as best he could between Track Team and
second nine, while Davy Richards, at last really
in his element, loomed large in importance. Davy
had a reputation as a trainer of track and field talent
to vindicate and Davy in the process of vindicating
was a fine imitation of a tyrant. Even Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Sargent forsook baseball for a space each day and
gave his attention to the weight men and jumpers,
for “Pete” in his day had held a college record for
two years with the hammer and had, as a side issue,
leaped his twenty-two feet-odd for the honor of the
Blue. So for one week at least baseball took a back
seat at Grafton and the real heroes were the slim-waisted,
bare-legged chaps in fluttering white trunks.</p>

<p>The ball team met Middleboro High School on
Wednesday afternoon and had no trouble in winning
a 14 to 3 contest that offered little in the way
of excitement or suspense to the listless spectators.
It was an intolerably hot day for May and audience
and players alike drooped. For Grafton, Nate
Leddy started the twirling, but after his teammates
had scored eight runs on the opponents in five innings
Nate ambled off and Joe Kelly tried his hand.
Joe was not a success, for the enemy took most
kindly to his slants, and after facing two innings
of trouble Joe likewise retired and Dud was given
his first taste of hostile batsmen.</p>

<p>With the score 12 to 3, Dud was not expected to
kill himself, and Ed Brooks, who had taken Gordon’s
place behind the plate with the advent of
Kelly on the mound, was all for an easy life. But
Brooks was reckoning without Dud’s ambition to
win a place on the list of battery candidates. Dud
had warmed the bench and twirled his glove during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
so many games that this opportunity presented itself
to him as Heaven-sent and he resolved to use all
the skill he knew and all the control he possessed.
For a fortnight he had been experimenting with his
curves again and, at Ben Myatt’s suggestion, had
even attempted a side-arm delivery that looked
promising. He had little fear of being punished
much, but he went to the mound and picked up the
ball determined to deny any sort of a hit to the
opponents. That is why he shook his head so frequently
at his catcher, much to that gentleman’s
surprise, and why when Middleboro’s tail-enders
faced him in that first of the eighth he worked so
carefully and cunningly that one after another the
three last batters on the list retired without even
fouling-off a ball! The Middleboro pitcher stood
like a graven image while Dud shot two fast ones
over the outer corner of the rubber, wasted one for
luck and then ended the inning with a slow ball
that floated as perfectly over the center as though
it had been rolled on wires! For the first time during
the game the somnolent spectators showed enthusiasm
as Dud dropped the ball and made for
the bench. Brooks squeezed in beside him and
thumped him on the knee.</p>

<p>“Great work, Dud!” he said. “We made ’em
look like pikers, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“You!” laughed Parker, sitting next him. “What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
did you do, Eddie? Baker scratched every signal
you gave him!”</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Brooks sarcastically. “Oh, nothing!
I just held him, that’s all! You get up there
and put your mitt against some of Dud’s fast ones
and see how simple it is! Say, Dud, it would be
fine if we could send them down in the next inning
the same way, eh? Only thing is, that fellow Dollard,
who bats second, is a pretty good hitter. He’s
made two already out of three times up.”</p>

<p>“What’s the first fellow like?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“Chapman? I guess that’s his name. Plays
third. Oh, he’s not dangerous. He wants his base.
Sneak over the first one for a strike and then tease
him a couple of times with high ones. He’ll go
after them every time. But Dollard’s not so easy.
He waits for the good ones.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to see that he doesn’t get them,”
replied Dud simply.</p>

<p>“Well, if you can keep on working the corners
the way you did last inning you’re all right. That
ump has his eyesight with him. If he didn’t you’d
get the worst of it lots of times.”</p>

<p>Grafton tallied twice more in her half of the
eighth and then Dud went back to the mound and
faced the small and stocky third-baseman. But he
wasn’t hard. Once Dud thought he had lost his
wish, but the ball rolled foul before it reached the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
third sack. After that there was no more trouble.
Chapman, if that was his name, bit at a high one
and missed it badly, let a ball go by and then again
swung too late at a fast one that crossed the plate
and retired disgruntled to the bench.</p>

<p>But Dollard was more canny. Dollard had to
have good ones. Dud tried him on two that looked
fair until they broke, but the batter treated them
with contempt. Then Dud tried him out with a
slow one and caught him napping. Dollard fouled
the next one into the stand and the score was two-and-two.
Brooks signaled for a straight one, hoping
to finish him off, but Dud shook his head. Instead,
he changed his position in the box a mite,
wrapped his fingers about the ball, wound up,
stepped forward and swung his arm wide at the
height of his elbow. Brooks had to jump for that
ball, for it proved a cross-fire indeed, and there was
a perceptible moment of hesitation before the umpire
reached his verdict. But when he did he said
“<em>You’re out!</em>” so decisively as to make up for the
hesitation. Dollard voiced objections all the way
to the bench and let it be known by the manner in
which he slammed his bat to earth that he was totally
out of sympathy with that umpire! But the
crowd cheered the strike-out and jeered the victim
and the next batsman stepped to his place.</p>

<p>Then, for once, and for the first time since he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
profited by Ben Myatt’s advice, Dud went back to
his hooks and that third batter swung and dodged
and swung again while Dud brought the game to
an end with exactly four deliveries!</p>

<p>Two days later there came the final cut in the
first squad and six disappointed candidates were
turned over to the second team. One of the six
was a pitcher, but his name was not Baker. It was
Kelly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>THE TRACK MEET</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was Saturday afternoon and Dud, squeezed
into a seat on the little grandstand between
Roy Dresser and Ernest Barnes, was watching
the Track and Field Meeting of Grafton and Mount
Morris. The baseball crowd had gone off to play
the Rotan College Freshman Team and by what
Dud considered a horrible error of judgment on
the part of the coach he had not been taken along.
Of course, he hadn’t expected to pitch even one
inning against the college nine, but he did think
that Mr. Sargent might have included him among
the substitutes. How was a fellow to learn if he
didn’t watch the team play? And to add to his
sense of injury, Jimmy had actually accompanied
the nine to play right field! Of course that was
only because Boynton was entered in the athletic
meet and someone had to take his place, but it didn’t
make Dud any more reconciled. There were moments
when he almost wished that the team would
run up against the defeat that was predicted for it!</p>

<p>Still, those moments were of the past, for during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the last half-hour Dud had been far too excited
over the events taking place before his eyes to
recall the injustice done him. The sprints, the half-mile,
the high hurdles, the shot-put and the high
jump had been decided and the rivals were within
two points of each other, Mount Morris leading
with 28. Just now nine eager youths, four wearing
the green-and-white of Mount Morris and five the
scarlet-and-gray of Grafton, were awaiting the pistol
at the start of the quarter-mile and Dud’s eyes were
riveted on them. Warren Yetter, on whom Grafton’s
hopes rested, was the second man from the
pole and, oddly enough, Kirkwell, the Mount Morris
crack, was at his right elbow. Dud could see them
talking to each other smilingly, but for all of that
a bit constrainedly. Then the nine bodies poised,
there was an instant’s silence and the sharp report
of the starting pistol sounded on the still air. The
runners leaped away, jockeyed for positions in the
first dozen strides and swept past the stand like
frightened deer. Dud was on his feet, and so too
were all those around him. Inarticulate sounds
made a background for the strident shouts and yells
of encouragement. Along the grass a Mount Morris
youth, an official of some sort, raced beside the
runners, dangling a white sweater with a broad
green band on it, yelping and urging. Now they
were at the first corner, Kirkwell leading and Yetter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
a yard behind him. Tenney, of Grafton, strove to
pass Yetter on the outside and was followed closely
by a Mount Morris runner. At the next corner the
first four were strung out and hugging the rim:
Kirkwell, Yetter, Tenney and Number 54. Dud
sought hurriedly for his program to discover the
identity of Number 54, realized the next moment
that he didn’t care, swept his gaze back across the
field quickly and joined his voice in the roar that
swept from the stand. Yetter was sprinting gamely
now. Only a yard separated him from Kirkwell.
Tenney was certain of third place. The finish was
only a few yards away. Yetter crept up and up!
The shouts increased. The stand was a pandemonium.
The officials, packed about the finish line,
were waving and shouting, too, all but the judges
and timers. Yetter and Kirkwell swept to the line
side by side! Or did they? Wasn’t the Mount
Morris man a little ahead as they disappeared behind
the group there? The tumult had quieted,
but now it broke forth again and the shouting came
from the other end of the stand. Across the field
a half-dozen jubilant Mount Morris fellows were
tossing their hats in air and signaling victory!</p>

<p>“That was a peach of a finish,” said Roy Dresser,
with a sigh of relief. “Warren almost had
him.”</p>

<p>“That puts them another point ahead,” said Dud,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
grudgingly crediting Mount Morris with 5. “Gee,
I thought Yetter was supposed to have the four-forty
cinched!”</p>

<p>“I guess he ran it inside his best time,” replied
Roy. “Kirkwell was better, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The announcer was bawling forth the result:
“Four-Hundred-and-Forty-Yards-Run! Won by C.
J. Kirkwell, Mount Morris! W. H. Yetter, Grafton,
second; A. L. Tenney, Grafton, third. Time,
52⅗ seconds!”</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Roy. “That’s a fifth better
than the dual record! I told you Warren was going
some!”</p>

<p>Dud tried to glean comfort from the fact, but
those five points stared at him obstinately. They
were putting the low hurdles across the cinder for
the final heat, while at the end of the oval lithe
forms sprang in air to waft themselves over the bar
nearly ten feet above the ground or to go, doubled
up like an animated jack-knife, flying into the brown
loam of the jumping pit. Behind the stand the
hammer-throwers were still busy. Dud watched
Jim Quinn launch himself upward with his long pole,
straighten a tense body and drop across the trembling
bar and sighed with relief. The pole vault
might decide the meeting and so far Quinn was more
than holding his own.</p>

<p>Musgrave and Keyes, of Grafton, and Torrey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
and Capper, of the rival school, crouched far up the
track. At the finish a handkerchief waved. The
four figures set, straightened and leaped away from
their marks and the sound of the pistol followed
them. Down they came, stride, stride, stride, leap;
Torrey gaining between hurdles, Keyes pulling him
back at the timbers; Musgrave and Capper falling
behind but fighting gamely for third place. On and
on to the growing roar of the excited watchers,
hurdle after hurdle falling behind. Torrey well in
advance now, but Keyes pushing him for every ounce
of strength in his body. Two more hurdles left.
Torrey is over! Keyes is over! A mad race for
the final obstacle, Torrey again gaining on the flat,
but Keyes, head back, feet twinkling, only a yard
behind. Up again and over, almost side by side
at the next stride. Then the dash to the string,
Torrey, arms upthrown, breaking it a stride ahead of
Keyes! Mount Morris shouts wildly and Grafton
joins, for Ned Musgrave has beaten out his rival
handily and again the points go five to Mount Morris
and four to Grafton, and Mount Morris had
been conceded first and third places!</p>

<p>Dud is a trifle comforted as he sinks back to his
seat and scratches agitatedly with his stubby pencil.
Barnes, munching chocolate philosophically, asks
the score.</p>

<p>“Thirty-eight to thirty-four,” replies Dud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“We’re a goner then.”</p>

<p>“We are not! Wait till the mile run comes off!
Foster Tray will win that at a walk, and we may
get second place too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Mount Morris will win the broad jump
and the hammer.” Barnes pushes the last of the
chocolate between stained lips and wipes sticky fingers
on a dingy handkerchief. “Say, I wonder
how the baseball game is coming out.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get licked. Here come the milers.
Who’s the fellow in the blue and yellow bathrobe,
Roy?”</p>

<p>“Milton. He ought to do pretty well. He ran
fifth last year and they say he’s a lot faster now.
I don’t see——”</p>

<p>“The bar is now at nine feet, ten and one-half
inches!” announces a voice, and they turn their gaze
to see a Mount Morris youth rise in air, straighten
and come hurtling to earth with the bar on top of
him.</p>

<p>“So sorry,” murmurs Roy Dresser. “Hope he
does it again next time.”</p>

<p>The megaphone artist trots into the middle of
the arena and faces the stand, a slip of paper in
his hand. The voices are stilled as he places the
scarlet horn to his mouth. “At the end of the fifth
inning——”</p>

<p>Deep silence now!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“—At Rotan the score stands: Grafton 5——”</p>

<p>An outburst of cheers, quickly stilled.</p>

<p>“—Rotan 11!”</p>

<p>A moment of gloom, broken by ironical cheers
from the Mount Morris end of the stand.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” asks Dud wonderingly.
“They must have hammered Myatt for
fair! Eleven to five! Gee!”</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” observes Barnes, “is
how we got five!”</p>

<p>Dud observes him in faint disgust. “Oh, I suppose
they gave them to us! Don’t you think we
can play ball at all?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think we could hit that fellow Gibbs,”
Barnes answers carelessly. “He’s a wonder, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well, even wonders have their off days. I
guess Myatt had one today! Gee, eleven runs!”</p>

<p>“I’m just as well pleased I didn’t go, Baker. The
crowd will be dead sore when they get back. It
costs nearly two dollars to make that trip.”</p>

<p>“We’ve just simply got to get this meet,” mutters
Dud. “We can’t get beaten all around today!”</p>

<p>“I’ve known it to happen,” says Roy unfeelingly.
“Here they go! Must be two dozen of ’em!”</p>

<p>In truth there were exactly fourteen, about evenly
divided between the two schools. They hustled
away confusedly and went to the corner weaving in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
and out, slowing their strides. Four times around
a quarter-mile track is no pleasure jaunt and they
knew it. Foster Tray was well in the rear of the
bunch and he stayed there as long as the pace suited
him, but at the finish of the first lap he had crawled
up to third place, with Towne, of Mount Morris,
and Milton, of Grafton, leading in that order. The
field was already strung out, for the pace had been
fairly fast for the tyros. In the backstretch a Mount
Morris youth sprinted from the center of the first
bunch and swept into the lead, no one disputing him.
But he lasted only to the beginning of the homestretch
and when the leaders came past the stand
again Towne was first and Tray second. Milton
was back in fourth place, behind a teammate. Then
came three Mount Morris fellows and, after them,
a straggling line of pluggers.</p>

<p>The time was shouted to them as they went by,
but there was too much shouting from the stand
for Dud to hear it. At the next corner Milton
hustled past the third runner and fell in behind Tray,
and Grafton cheered that indication of pluck. But
by the time the backstretch was once more ahead
Towne and Tray were yards to the good and both
Milton and the man behind him were losing ground.
There was no sign of weariness shown by either of
the leaders. Towne was running a fine, steady race
and seemed well within himself. Tray, not so pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
a runner, looked to be tiring, but he kept his position
to the fraction of an inch, a single stride behind
his rival, his spikes hugging the rim closely. Around
the corners they came, into the stretch, to a chorus
of cheers and shouts and shrill yells of advice, entreaty
and encouragement. The gong clanged its
announcement of the final lap. Fifteen yards or so
behind the two leaders came Milton, fighting doggedly
to keep ahead of a Mount Morris youth but
losing gradually. By this time the track showed
tired contestants everywhere. Towne and Tray
were already lapping the rear-guard.</p>

<p>Stride for stride, the green ribbon and the scarlet
passed the turns and reached the backstretch.
There was still no sign of a change of pace, no altering
of the steady strides. Now they were half-way
through the final circuit, moving together across
the green turf like a single machine. But suddenly
cries leapt from the watchers. Towne had started
his sprint! Already a yard separated the two! And
now it was a good two strides! They were rounding
the third corner, heads back, digging for all they
were worth! Tray was falling behind! The spectators
in the stand were on their feet, hands outstretched
and beckoning, lungs roaring forth shouts
of triumph or of despair. Into the stretch the two
white-clad figures swept. Surely Tray had pulled
up again! He had! He was running stride for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
stride with the Mount Morris man! He was gaining!
Why, there was nothing to it but Tray! What
a sprint! Two yards between them now, three—four!
And Tray still opening up daylight and the
finish growing nearer and nearer! The stand was
emptying, the audience piling down to crowd the
track at the finish line. It was difficult to see now,
but there was a head bobbing up and down a few
yards away, and another——</p>

<p>“<em>Track! Track! Keep back there! Give them
room, fellows!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Grafton! Grafton! Grafton!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Tray! Tray! Tray!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Come on, Towne! Mount Morris! Mount
Morris!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>You can do it! Come on! Come on!</em>”</p>

<p>Then a veritable babel of sound as a white-clad
runner stumbles into sight at the end of the throng,
is caught by ready arms and borne staggering to
the turf. Grafton cheers fill the air. Another runner
subsides on the grass. Cries of “<em>Track! Track!
Let them finish! Everyone off the track!</em>” And
then Milton, white of face, dragging his unwilling
feet beneath him, fighting for breath, crosses the
line a scant two yards ahead of a Mount Morris
youth and plunges forward on his face. After that
they jog in one by one, but no one sees them, for the
race is over and Grafton has won first place and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
third and added eight much-needed points to her
score!</p>

<p>Dud, separated in the confusion of that rush
down from the stand from his companion, waited to
hear the announcement of the time, hoping to learn
that Foster Tray had made a new record for the
mile. But four minutes and fifty-four seconds was
not sensational, and so he followed the crowd to
the pole-vault. The broad jumpers had just finished
and Mount Morris had won first place, leaving four
points for Grafton, and the figures stood 46 to 44,
the Green-and-White still two points ahead. The
hammer-throw had not yet been heard from, Dud
learned, but Quinn was sure of first in the pole-vault.
Dud joined the ranks of the anxious onlookers
and watched while Mount Morris’s talent
tried and failed to equal Jim Quinn’s ten feet and
one inch, watched while Hanson of Grafton struggled
for third place in the vault-off between him and
Joy of Mount Morris and grieved when he lost out.
And then, while Dud was figuring and calculating
and staring at the unwelcome result which showed
Mount Morris still a point ahead, a wildly leaping
junior shot around the stand bringing an end to
suspense.</p>

<p>Grafton had won first and second place in the
hammer-throw! Driver had thrown a hundred and
thirty-nine feet and four inches! And Gowen had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
done almost as well! And Mount Morris’s best
was only——</p>

<p>But Dud didn’t care what Mount Morris’s best
had been! He was scrawling a big black 8 on his
program and shouting to no one in particular:</p>

<p>“What do you know about that? Grafton, 57;
Mount Morris, 51! Well, I guess! Six points
to the good! Oh, we’re not so bad, not so bad!
Fifty-seven to fifty-one! What do you know about
that?”</p>

<p>No one heard him, I fancy, for there was a great
deal of noise about that time.</p>

<small>BASEBALL, TENNIS AND OYSTERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was yet nearly three-quarters of an
hour before supper time and Dud, still
elated and excited over the track victory,
turned his steps to River Street and, skirting the
school grounds, swung west and made for the station.
The ball team, unless it missed its connection
at the Junction, would be in at a quarter to six. Dud
was not alone in his journey to the station, for the
carriages bearing the Mount Morris athletes passed
him half-way along the shaded village road and
several boys, fortunate youths living nearby who
had procured leave of absence over Sunday, were
trailing along, suit-cases in hand. Dud witnessed
the departure of the Mount Morris track team and
the fellows off for home and then, seated on a baggage-truck,
watched the shadows creep down the
hillside across the tracks and thought of a great
many things. He speculated on what had happened
at Rotan to result in Grafton’s defeat, wondered
whether by any stroke of fortune the Scarlet-and-Gray
had redeemed herself in the later innings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
then tried to imagine himself in the box for Grafton,
facing those doughty Rotan freshies and mowing
them down one-two-three! He couldn’t quite
visualize the scene, however, and gave up with a
sigh. Then he wondered how long it would be before
Mr. Sargent would let him start a game, and
what would happen when he did! And at that instant
there was a whistle far down the track, the
few loiterers came to life along the platform and
the baggage man requisitioned his truck.</p>

<p>Jimmie was one of the first off the train and was
all for returning to school in the barge until Dud
reminded him that he had walked all the way over
to meet him and didn’t propose to pay any fifteen
cents to ride back. Whereupon Jimmie good-naturedly
set out with his chum on foot.</p>

<p>“Twelve to seven,” he answered in reply to Dud’s
request for the final figures. “What was the matter?
Why, nothing much, except that we couldn’t
hit that pitcher of theirs and they slammed Myatt
all over the lot in the third. Why the dickens
Pete didn’t yank him out I don’t know. Maybe it’s
just as well he didn’t, though. I guess they’d have
battered Leddy something brutal. Those dubs sure
can hit the pill, son!”</p>

<p>“How did you get on?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“Rotten, thanks! I muffed a peach of a fly and
let two runs cross, worse luck! It was in that awful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
third. The sun got square in my eyes just at the
last moment. I had the old thing sighted nicely
until I had to drop my hands to make the catch.
Then it went plum through ’em. There were three
on bases and so two of them scored. The other
one could have, too, if he’d had any sense, for it
took me about ten seconds to find the ball after I
muffed it. But the fellow slowed up at third and
by that time it was too late.”</p>

<p>“Did you hit any?”</p>

<p>“I got one, and it was a corker. I’d have had
two bases on it if Blake hadn’t held me up at first,
the chump! I wasn’t awfully strong with the stick,
Dud, but I got a base every time I went up!”</p>

<p>“You did? How, for pity’s sake?”</p>

<p>“Well, the first time I rolled one in front of
base and the catcher threw to second to get Ordway.
He didn’t, though, for Hobo’s a regular flash on the
bases, and we were both safe. The next time I got
pinked in the arm, the next time I hit between short
and third—some little sizzler, that was, old scout!—and
the last time I worked Mr. Pitcher for a
pass.”</p>

<p>“Gee, you’re a lucky chap,” said Dud enviously.</p>

<p>“Lucky? Nothing of the sort. Brains, son,
brains! Besides, do you call it lucky to have a
long, easy fly go right through your fingers? Huh!
Luck didn’t do anything for little Jimmy today!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Say, how’d the meet come out? Heard we’d won it,
but what was the score?”</p>

<p>They talked track meeting until the campus was
reached and then Dud returned to the subject of the
ball game. “They tried Star Meyer in center for
a couple of innings; Parker got his leg spiked and
Star wasn’t so bad. Made a pretty catch of a long
one that went nearly to the fence and managed to
beat out a bunt in the ninth. I suppose the first
thing I know I’ll have to down him as well as Boynton.”</p>

<p>Dud looked surprised. “Do you think you’ve
got a show, Jimmy?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the other, bristling. “Boynton’s
not much better than I am. He muffs ’em, too,
now and then. Of course, he’s hitting better, but
I’ll wager he doesn’t get to first any oftener. But
if they go and lug Star into the business, why,
that’s different. I can’t win out against the whole
school!”</p>

<p>“But you say they played Star in center. And
you’re after right, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m after anything I can get, son. A fellow
who can play center can play right or left, can’t
he? An outfielder’s just an outfielder, you see, and
you can’t play more than three of ’em at a time—and
get away with it. Just now there are about six
of us, all trying for three jobs. I wish Star Meyer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
would go soak his head and not butt in on baseball!”</p>

<p>Dud laughed. “You might suggest it to him,
Jimmy. Who pitched besides Myatt? Did Brunswick
get in?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. Ben went the distance. They couldn’t
touch him much after that rotten third. Got a
couple of hits in the fifth and about one each inning
after that. They made their last run in the
eighth with two down. A fellow cracked a two-bagger
down the left foul-line and tried to steal
third, and did it because Winslow let the ball drop.
Then the next fellow hit an easy one to Ayer and
Myatt didn’t cover base in time and the chap on
third scrambled in. I guess it was just as well Pete
didn’t derrick Ben, after all, because he certainly
pitched a corking game after that third inning. Gee,
but I’m hungry! Wish I was at training table,” he
added wistfully. “They get steaks there!”</p>

<p>They went over to Nick Blake’s room after supper
and found Hugh and Bert and Guy Murtha
there, and there was much baseball talked and many
“might-have-beens” discussed. Dud, as a non-participant,
had little to say, and Hugh, who might
have talked a good deal since he had rather distinguished
himself by his work at the bat and on the
bases, was almost as silent. After awhile, on the
excuse of showing Dud a new book, Hugh led the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
other off upstairs and they settled down full-length
on the window-seat, beside the open casements, and
had a fine, chummy talk. Dud could talk well
enough when there was but a single listener, and tonight
Hugh found the younger boy far from dull.
By the time Bert Winslow came in, yawning, they
had discovered numerous bonds of sympathy such as
mutual likes and dislikes and an intense desire to
make good at baseball. Hugh, entering the game
as the veriest tyro and with a deal of doubt and
not much enthusiasm, was now a rabid “fan” and
almost amusingly eager to make a name for himself.</p>

<p>Bert, I think, wanted to go to bed, but was too
polite to start while there was a visitor present, and
so toppled into a chair and joined the conversation.
Dud realized that Bert didn’t care very much for
him and so tried to get away a few minutes after
the other’s advent, but Hugh wouldn’t have it.</p>

<p>“Oh, sit down and behave yourself, Baker! It
isn’t late. I say, Bert, Baker and I have been discovering
that we have lots of things in common, if
you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Bert stifled a yawn. “Such as what,
’Ighness?”</p>

<p>“Oh, baseball, for one, you know. Tennis, too.
And oysters——”</p>

<p>“Oysters!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. You see I happened to think that a dozen
nice cold raw oysters would taste corking. They
would, wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Out of season, you chump.”</p>

<p>“Never! That’s only prejudice, old chap. Well,
anyway, oysters was one thing—<em>were</em> one thing, I
should say. English is beastly confusing at times,
eh? And then we found that Baker knew my part
of the country, down Maryland way, you know.
He comes from Delaware.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” laughed Bert.</p>

<p>“Delaware,” replied Dud, smiling, “is small but
select. Where’s your home, Winslow?”</p>

<p>“Pennsylvania; Shrevesport. Know it?”</p>

<p>Dud shook his head. “Some of my folks lived
in Pennsylvania once, a good many years ago.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good state. They were foolish to leave
it,” yawned Bert. “Hope they didn’t have to?”</p>

<p>“Why, in a way I believe they did. You see
one of them was an officer in the American Army,
and when Howe occupied Philadelphia they thought
it might not be healthy.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bert. Hugh smiled.</p>

<p>“Still,” continued Bert, “they needn’t have gone
to Delaware, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they did just then. A couple of
them were with Washington at Valley Forge. I
think the women went to New Jersey until Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
was evacuated again. I don’t know just what
happened then. We’ve been living in Delaware
only since my grandfather’s time. He moved there
from Philadelphia to improve his state.”</p>

<p>“Improve his state? You mean he was—was
hard up?” asked Bert suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I can’t say. I’ve been told it was to improve
his state. That’s all I know.”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed. “You began it, Bert! Honors
are even. As judge of the debate, I declare it a
draw.”</p>

<p>Bert smiled slowly. Then: “All right, Baker,”
he said amiably, “you win! Fact is, I don’t know
anything about Delaware or a thing against it.
Sorry if I trod on your toes.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t, Winslow; I moved them out of the
way,” laughed Dud.</p>

<p>After the latter had taken his departure and the
two roommates were preparing for bed, Hugh heard
a grunt from the opposite chamber. “What’s troubling
you?” he called.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was the answer. “I was just thinking
that that kid isn’t such a fool, after all, eh?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Hugh, winking at himself in the
glass, “I rather fancy he had you, old top.”</p>

<p>Bert’s only response was another grunt, but it
sounded assenting.</p>

<small>DUD GOES TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Grafton had now played seven contests
with outside teams and had won five and
lost two. Six games remained; seven in
case it became necessary to play a third game with
Mount Morris. On the whole the nine had showed
average strength. The pitching had been good and
defensively the team had more than held its own
against contenders. But both Coach Sargent and
Captain Murtha would have been anything but displeased
if the batting had been heavier or had even
shown promise of improvement. The remaining
games were all, with the exception of that with Yarrow
High School, scheduled just before the second
Mount Morris contest, hard ones. St. James Academy
especially was looked on as a difficult opponent,
and Lawrence Textile School as scarcely less dangerous.
Both teams boasted pitchers of reputation,
and unless Grafton’s stick work improved she was
not likely to pile up much of a score against either
visitor. Of course, it could be argued that a team
with a perfect defense is in no danger of defeat, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
on the other hand, a team with no power of attack
can’t win games. And Guy Murtha, being captain
and in his last year at school, naturally wanted very
much to come off victor in those remaining contests.
Fortunately, the St. James and Lawrence Textile
games were to be played on Lothrop Field, a circumstance
which would aid to some extent. The
meeting with Corliss College was to be played away
from home, but Corliss—or Careless, as the Graftonians
liked to call it—while strong, was not the
problem that either of the other two was. As for
Yarrow High—well, that was only a practice game
to fill in between the first Mount Morris engagement
on the ninth of June, which was a Saturday, and
the second one, which fell on the following Friday,
the Mount Morris Class Day. In case each of the
ancient rivals secured a game the play-off would
be at Grafton the next day, the teams remaining
after the close of the schools to settle the controversy.</p>

<p>On the Monday succeeding their defeat at Rotan
the players were given a particularly strenuous afternoon
of it. With the exception of Gordon Parker,
whose leg still protested at the injury done it by
a Rotan baseman’s spikes, all the players were out
and not one was spared, unless we exempt Ben
Myatt. Dud put in a hard afternoon, for he pitched
six innings for the scrubs and was fairly well hammered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Still, he managed to keep the hits of the
regulars so well scattered that Mr. Sargent was satisfied
to leave him on the mound until, in the seventh,
it became advisable to let a pinch hitter take
his place. After that Weston finished up for the
scrubs and was so erratic that the one-run lead
handed over to him by Dud soon vanished, the regulars
winning out by the score of 9 to 6. When Dud
heard the result in the Field House later he tried
to be sorry for Weston, but the effort wasn’t very
successful. Dud, you see, was already entertaining
visions of pitching a half-game or so against Mount
Morris and thus winning his letter. Not that the
letter part of it interested him so much, however.
Just the glory of being in a Mount Morris game
would be enough for him. Of course, he couldn’t
figure out as yet just how that desirable result was
to come about. There was Ben Myatt for the first
game and Nate Leddy for the second, or the other
way around, with Weston to take a hand if needed.
As for Brunswick, Dud wasn’t worrying about him.
Brunswick was keeping along at about the same
pace he had begun the season on, neither worse nor
better, while Dud could honestly assure himself that
he was improving from day to day, or, at least,
from game to game. And he didn’t have to rely
wholly on his own verdict, for others had seen
the improvement and told him of it. Ben Myatt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
had praised him warmly, Captain Murtha had had
a good word more than once and Mr. Sargent had
let Dud see that he wasn’t blind to the latter’s growing
ability.</p>

<p>But Dud was forced to presuppose a third game
in the big series before he could see himself turning
back the Mount Morris hitters, and a third
game might not materialize. Of course, if Gus
Weston kept on blowing up every time he went into
the points, why, that would improve Dud’s chances
a whole lot, and it was this thought that made it difficult
for Dud to grieve over the loss of that game
to the scrubs! With Weston out of the way——</p>

<p>But Weston was an old hand, had been pitching
for three years and was just as likely to steady down
again the next time and send his stock soaring again.
All that was to be done, reflected Dud, was to hope
for the best—which, from Gus Weston’s point of
view, was the worst!—and keep right on getting
better and better every day. He didn’t wish anyone
ill luck, but if only Leddy might have a slight
attack of measles or something and Gus Weston develop
a bum wing—well, Dud was forced to admit
that it would be Providential!</p>

<p>But the measles didn’t afflict Leddy nor did Weston
complain of trouble in his arm, and practice went
on each day and Dud pitched or didn’t pitch but
always stood in front of the net and took his turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
at “looking like a silly goat,” to use his own expression,
while he tried to connect with the puzzling offerings
of Leddy or Weston or Brunswick.</p>

<p>St. James descended like a wolf on the fold on
Wednesday and took Grafton’s measure without a
great deal of trouble. To be sure, the game went
to the fifth inning before St. James solved Leddy’s
slants and by that time Grafton had herself assailed
the opposing twirler for three hits and scored one
run. But when the visitors did take to Leddy’s ways
they took enthusiastically. Nate got through the
fifth with difficulty, some brainless base-running on
the part of the enemy aiding him out of a tight place,
but in the sixth, after the bases were filled with
only one out and two runs already across, he was
retired from service and Myatt went in to save the
day. And Myatt might have done it had he been
backed by errorless fielding, but Nick Blake booted
one in the seventh and Ayer fumbled a heave a minute
later and two more runs came over. Grafton
managed to add to her score in the eighth, increasing
it to two when Winslow cracked out a two-bagger
after Nick Blake had been passed to first and
had stolen second. But that was the last of the
home team’s scoring, while, just to clinch the game,
St. James broke through with a couple of hits, one
good for two bases, and added a fifth run in the
ninth. Grafton tried everything she knew in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
effort to start a rally in the last half of that inning,
but the best she could do was to get Ayer as far
as third base, at which station he remained while
Hugh Ordway reached first on a weak infield hit
that bounded erratically, and Jimmy, batting for
Boynton, hit into a double, his luck for once deserting
him. So 5 to 2 was the final score, and it pretty
fairly represented the merits of the two teams. St.
James had been there with the hits when hits meant
runs and Grafton had failed to show any attack
worthy the name. In view of results, it was cold
comfort to know that, outside two errors and a
wild pitch by Leddy, she had played an excellent
defensive game. Results were what counted and
another defeat had been scored up against Grafton.</p>

<p>That game came off on the last day but one in
May, and on Friday June came in with a spell of
torrid weather. The heat combined with the knowledge
of impending final examinations tended to rather
take the starch out of fellows, and the ball players
were no exception. Practice became half-hearted, in
spite of Guy Murtha’s impassioned pleas and scoldings,
and when Saturday dawned things looked bad
for Grafton as regarded that Lawrence Textile contest.
Most of the fellows were pulling their feet behind
them and wearing worried frowns. The mercury
climbed up to eighty-four at noon that day and
what breeze had made life bearable in the forenoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
died away entirely. Lawrence arrived shortly after
one o’clock and, after getting a taste of conditions in
the region of Grafton, willingly consented to a postponement
of the start of the game from two-thirty
to three o’clock. The delay, however, was of not
much avail, for at the half-hour it was just as hot
as it had been at two-thirty, and the spectators went
to the field armed with newspapers and fans and all
sorts of devices to shield their perspiring countenances.</p>

<p>Coach Sargent again altered the batting order.
Parker, while probably able to get in, was not used
and Jimmy took his place in center field. Hugh
Ordway went to third place on the list and Jimmy to
seventh. Ben Myatt started the game, with Gordon
behind the bat. Lawrence’s twirler was a tall,
able-looking chap of about twenty years, unless appearances
were deceptive, named Fairway. Nick
Blake was responsible for an excruciating pun when,
during Grafton’s third time at bat, he confided to
Jimmy that it looked as if that pitcher was in a fair
way to beat them. Jimmy charitably assumed that
Nick was affected by the heat. Up to that time
neither team had presented more than three men at
the plate in an inning, the two pitchers going very
smoothly and working the corners for all they were
worth. But in that last of the third the luck broke
for the home team.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>Jimmy, surviving Nick’s pun, chose a likely bat
and took his stand. Being first man up, it was required
of Jimmy that he secure his base by any
method short of robbery. Fairway sneaked the
first one over on him and teased him with a slow
ball, which Jimmy wisely let pass. After that an
attempt to bunt resulted in a foul down the third-base
side. With two against him, Jimmy took a
firmer grip of his bat and bent all his energies to
the task. Naturally, Fairway could afford to waste
a ball, and did so, and it was two-and-two. Jimmy
took heart. The next one looked good and he swung
briskly. Another foul resulted, the first-baseman
almost making the catch. Another offering curved
up to him and again he laid his bat against it and
again it went foul. Fairway dragged his sleeve
across his perspiring face, had a good look at the
signals and unlimbered. The ball shot in, knee-high
and looking good, and Jimmy started his swing.
But something warned him in time and he recovered
just as the ball took a most deceptive drop in front
of the plate.</p>

<p>“Ball—three!” called the umpire. Jimmy grinned
and hitched his trousers. From the bench came encouraging
and approving cries. Jimmy stepped out
of the box and wiped his damp hands in the dust.
Then he wiped them on his trousers. Then he
stepped back with bat poised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“All right, Fairy!” called the catcher. “Right
over now, old man!”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s smile broadened. “Fairy” was such an
amusing title for that tall, husky youth down there!
Then the ball was singing up to him, his bat was
swinging at it, there was a <em>slap</em> and Jimmy was legging
it to first. But again he had fouled, and again
the Fates that rule over the lives of such as James
Townsend Logan came to his rescue. The catcher,
running back with gaze set skyward, hands poised
for the descending ball, managed at the last instant
to get the sun’s rays fairly in his eyes. The ball
struck his mitten, bounded out, was juggled and
dropped to the sod. A shrill shout of joy arose from
the Grafton bench. The catcher angrily sped
the ball to third and looked for his mask in a
very disgruntled manner. Jimmy held it out to
him.</p>

<p>“Hard luck,” said Jimmy consolingly. “Next
time I’ll put it where you can catch it.”</p>

<p>The Lawrence backstop grunted.</p>

<p>That trifling incident proved psychological, as
many trifling incidents do in baseball, and Fairway’s
next attempt at a strike passed a foot wide of the
base, and Jimmy, dropping his bat, trotted to base
amidst the plaudits and laughter of the spectators.
The coachers got busy on the instant, Captain Murtha
at first and Bert Winslow at third, and sent a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
veritable fusillade of interesting remarks across the
diamond.</p>

<p>“On your toes, Jimmy! Take a lead! Watch
his arm! Look out! Up again! At a boy! Here
we go! Go on! Go on! <em>Who-oa!</em>”</p>

<p>Jimmy, hooking a leg back to the bag, grinned,
climbed to his feet again, shook the dust from his
togs and inched along the base line. Fairway gave
him up after two attempts and turned his attention
to Pete Gordon. Gordon was there to sacrifice, of
course, and the safest way to do it was to bunt.
But Pete was the slugging kind of a hitter, the sort
who doesn’t very frequently connect, but slams out
wicked liners or screeching flies when he does.
Bunting, therefore, was not his strong suit, and his
two attempts failed, the first one going foul and the
second resulting in a harmless swing against the
atmosphere. After that, with two strikes against
him and only one ball to his credit, Pete was not
dangerous, and when he finally hit one it arched
amiably into center fielder’s hands and Jimmy retraced
his steps to first.</p>

<p>Myatt, however, did better, for Ben landed
against the second delivery and whizzed it over the
pitcher’s upraised glove and safely into the field,
and Jimmy slid to second unhurriedly. Nick Blake
went out on strikes, and it was Bert Winslow who
came through with the longed-for safety, rapping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
the ball straight down first base line and a yard to
the right of the baseman’s best reach. Jimmy
scampered home, Myatt reached third, and
Bert managed to get to second ahead of right
fielder’s throw. But that ended Grafton’s chances
for the time, for the best Hugh could do was to
lift a fly to short left that shortstop got after a
run.</p>

<p>At one to nothing the game went to the fifth,
Myatt holding the enemy harmless in the fourth and
Grafton failing to reach first base in her half. But
in the first of the fifth a fumble by Winslow put a
runner on first. Myatt struck out the next two batsmen
and Grafton’s adherents began to breathe easier.
But Fairway, the Lawrence twirler, who had
fanned ingloriously the time before, took a liking to
Myatt’s first offering and poked it straight between
Blake and Winslow. Result, an eager youth on third
casting longing eyes at the plate! Also, an equally
anxious runner on second, Fairway having gone on
to that sack during the throw to the plate.</p>

<p>Myatt started in with the head of the opposing
batting list by putting himself promptly in the hole,
pitching three remarkably poor balls one after another.
Then he got two strikes across, neither of
which was offered at, and tried to follow it with a
third. But the heat was beginning to tell on Myatt,
and the next attempt, while it looked pretty good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
from the bench, was adjudged a ball and the bases
were full.</p>

<p>“Weston,” called Mr. Sargent, “get a ball! You,
too, Baker.”</p>

<p>Possibly the sight of the two relief pitchers and
Brooks trudging off to warm up put Myatt on his
mettle, for he fairly stood the next batsman on his
ear, fanning him with just four deliveries while the
Grafton sympathizers cheered and yelped. Three
disappointed runners left as many bases and turned
sadly to their positions.</p>

<p>Grafton tried hard to add to her score in her half
of the fifth, but Fairway was quite master of the situation.
The sixth passed without a thrill, even if
Lawrence did manage to work a pass and get a
scratch hit. Nothing came of it, for Blake, Murtha
and Ayer pulled off a double and stopped the rampage.
For Grafton, Winslow, Ordway and Murtha
went out in order.</p>

<p>The seventh witnessed Myatt’s Waterloo. For
several innings he had been in bad shape owing to
the heat, and when he faced the first batsman in the
seventh it was not difficult to see that he was working
on pure nerve. When the first man had found
him for a single and he had pitched three balls to
the second, Murtha stepped over and held a conference.
Myatt shook his head and Bert Winslow
joined them. Over behind third Gus Weston and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
Dud had taken up their work again, and Will
Brunswick had been sent to join them.</p>

<p>“There’s a job open for somebody,” remarked
Brooks, throwing the ball to Gus. “Ben’s quitting.”</p>

<p>The three pitchers, their backs to the bench, never
turned, but three pairs of ears were, you may be
certain, very alert. It was Weston who was summoned,
and Gus, throwing aside his sweater, which
he had worn tied across his chest, lolled onto the
field. Dud watched him enviously, first because he
had been chosen to relieve Myatt and secondly because
he was able to approach the honor with such
a wonderful assumption of indifference!</p>

<p>Weston pitched his trial deliveries, rather wildly
as a matter of fact, received the intelligence that the
batter had three balls to his credit and no strikes, and
instantly supplied him with a fourth! The Lawrence
coaches and the Lawrence players on the bench
hooted and jeered joyfully as the batsman walked to
first, the runner on first jogged down to second.
But that was what might have been expected, that
pass to the batter, for it is no mean task to go to
the mound with the score three against you and keep
the batsman from walking. Dud had to acknowledge
that as he and Brunswick and Brooks retired
to the thin strip of shade afforded by the little house
in which were stored the tennis nets.</p>

<p>But this was not Weston’s day. To Grafton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
dismay, Gus very promptly passed the third man,
working only one strike against him, and behold, the
bases were filled and there were no outs! So suddenly
can the fortunes of battle shift in the game of
baseball! Brooks, his gaze on the bench, jumped
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows!” he said. “At it again!
Peter signaled.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” murmured Brunswick, “I don’t see much
use warming up a day like this! I haven’t a square
inch on me that’s dry!”</p>

<p>“Never mind your troubles, Willie; shoot ’em!”
responded Brooks, grinning as he drew his mitt on.
“One of you guys will have to go in there in about
two shakes. They’re holding the game now for
you to limber up your old arms. Shoot ’em, Dud!”</p>

<p>Over on the diamond Captain Murtha and Bert
Winslow and Nick Blake had surrounded the unfortunate
Weston, Pete Gordon, ball in hand, standing
guard at the plate. A faint breeze came up from
the river and awakened murmurs of relief from
the sweltering spectators. Lawrence demanded that
the game go on, half a dozen impetuous youths
leaping from the bench to confront the umpire. The
group in the center of the diamond melted and Weston
held up his hand for the ball. Gordon tossed
it back to him, knelt and signaled.</p>

<p>“All right, Gus, now?” he encouraged. “Make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
’em good, old man! Let’s get this one! Slide ’em
over!”</p>

<p>The infielders crept up to short-field, the runners
capered and took daring leads and the coachers
shouted themselves hoarse. Gus wound up and shot
the ball away. It dropped prettily across the base,
but the batter refused it and the umpire upheld him.</p>

<p>“Ball!” announced the latter. Weston, hands on
bent knees, stared as though dumfounded. Then he
straightened, turned on his heel and cast his arms
derisively apart. Lawrence jeered enjoyably.</p>

<p>“Pretty good, Gus,” called Gordon. “Never
mind, though. Let’s have it this time!”</p>

<p>But Weston, though he took time and pains, shot
one in that sent the batsman staggering out of his
box and sent Guy Murtha to the mound. “That’ll
do, Gus,” said Guy. “This isn’t your day, old man.”</p>

<p>“It’s so beastly hot,” grumbled Weston.</p>

<p>Murtha nodded non-committingly and raised
a hand. At the bench Mr. Sargent turned to Nate
Leddy. “Better warm up,” he said. “We may
need you. Send Baker in.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">The coach met Dud at third. He appeared
smiling and unworried, but his characteristic
trick of jumbling his words betrayed the
fact that he was not as calm as he looked.</p>

<p>“Think you can go in there and pull us out of this
mess, Baker?” he asked. “Take all the time you
want and set your gignals right—I mean get your
rignals sight—er—well, go ahead, my boy, and show
what you can do!”</p>

<p>Dud made no answer, which was perhaps just as
well since had he replied truthfully to the coach’s
question he would have been forced to say that he
was quite certain that he couldn’t do anything of
the sort! Instead, he walked toward the mound
with a fair appearance of ease and in a condition
of blue funk. Murtha met him, and although the
latter smiled cheerfully and tried his best to look as
if he thought all his troubles were now past, it
wasn’t difficult for Dud to perceive that the captain
was a bit disappointed in Mr. Sargent’s selection.
He would have much preferred Nate Leddy, but he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
had a good deal of confidence in the coach’s judgment
and, after all, young Baker had shown real
pitching more than once.</p>

<p>“Good boy, Baker,” he said cheerfully. “Let’s
see what you can do now. Listen, let Gordon do
the head-work, see? Just try to give him what he
wants. They’ve got three on and no one out, Baker,
and the score’s two against you. Whatever you do,
old man, don’t pass him. Let him hit if you have
to and try to make him pop up. Do your best,
Baker, for we want this game!”</p>

<p>Guy handed him the ball and Dud, very trembly
at the knees, conscious of the hot glare of sunlight
that made heat waves dance along the paths, conscious
of the encouraging voices of teammates and of
hearty applause from the stand, wrapped his fingers
about the leather and sent in his first “warming-up”
ball. A whoop of joy and derision came from the
visitors’ bench, for the ball had almost eluded the
spry Gordon. Back it came and Dud, trying his
best to calm his nerves, shot it in again. It was
all right that time and the next. Then the ball
struck the ground in front of the plate and Gordon
had to drop and block it. One more, high and wide,
ended the practice and the Lawrence third-baseman
stepped up to the plate again as the umpire called
“Play!” From the Lawrence bench and from the
Lawrence coachers came a sudden hubbub of sound,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
but through it Dud heard Nick Blake’s cheerful
voice.</p>

<p>“We’re all with you, Dud! Go to it, son!”</p>

<p>“Dud!” Nick had never called him that before,
and somehow the thought steadied him remarkably.
To be sure, his knees were still a trifle wobbly as he
studied Gordon’s fingers laid against the back of
his mitt, but the stage-fright was passing.</p>

<p>“Let’s get him, Baker,” called Gordon as he arose
from his crouch and held hands wide apart. “You’ve
got the stuff, old man!”</p>

<p>With a man on third watching for the least excuse
to race home, a full wind-up was out of the question,
and Dud realized that he must depend more on
cunning than speed. Gordon had shown three fingers
horizontal, and three fingers horizontal called
for a low curve ball. Dud, emulating the example
of Myatt, surveyed the bases slowly, pulled his cap
down, tried to shut out the wild cries of the coachers,
snuggled the ball in his fingers, threw his arm
up, took his stride and pitched.</p>

<p>At the plate the batter moved up on the ball, hesitated
and let it pass.</p>

<p>“Strike!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>There was cheering from the stand, yells of triumph
from the players in the field, but Dud scarcely
heard them. Gordon, walking down the alley,
thumped ball and mitt together. “That’s the stuff,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Baker!” he cried. “One-and-two now! Let’s have
him out!” He tossed the ball back, a watchful eye
on third, went back to his place, crouched, signaled
and again held hands wide apart. He wanted
a drop and he got it, but it shaved too closely the
outer corner and the umpire judged it a ball. Gordon
turned indignantly.</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>”</p>

<p>“You heard what I said,” returned the official
crisply.</p>

<p>Gordon grinned and returned the ball. “It looked
good, Baker! Let’s have it again!”</p>

<p>But it was “one finger” this time, and the fast
one that sailed straight across the plate caught the
batsman napping, and the umpire’s “<em>Strike—two!</em>”
was drowned in a shout of joy from the Grafton
sympathizers.</p>

<p>“That’s the pitching, Dud!” called Nick, scooping
a handful of dust from the base path and tossing
it joyfully into the air. “Fine work, Baker!”
“Keep after him!” “No one walks!” They were
all calling encouragement to him now. He almost
forgot the shouting, cavorting runners and the bawling
coachers. Back came the ball once more, Gordon
grinning widely. Then he dropped to one knee
and laid four fingers across the big brown mitt.</p>

<p>“Right in the slot, old man! He can’t see ’em!
At a boy! Let her come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>And Dud let her! It was a slow one that did the
trick, a ball that sped away from the mound with
all the ear-marks of a moderately fast straight delivery
but that never crossed the rubber until the
batsman’s sharp swing had passed harmlessly.
Then it descended into Gordon’s eager hands and
the umpire waved an arm skyward.</p>

<p>“<em>He’s out!</em>”</p>

<p>How the stand shouted then and how silent the
Lawrence bench suddenly became! The third-baseman,
disgusted and puzzled, dragged his dishonored
bat away with him and tossed it contemptuously
into the pile. But that was only one down, and a
big, capable-looking youth with a grim determination
shown in his tight-set mouth was already waiting.
A wide one that went as a ball, a drop that the
batter tried for and missed, a second ball—Dud
had attempted to cut the inner corner of the plate
with a hook and had failed by an inch—and then,
in response to Gordon’s signal of one finger, a fast
one that reached the batsman waist-high and which
he met with his bat.</p>

<p><em>Crack!</em></p>

<p>He was speeding to first, the bases were emptying.
Dud, heart in mouth, turned in time to see Nick
Blake spring two feet into the air and spear the
ball, and then, without a wasted motion, dash across
the second sack a scant instant before the runner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
from first slid, feet foremost, into it in a cloud of
dust!</p>

<p>Nick had played the double unassisted and the
side was out! Grafton stood up in the stand and
shouted herself hoarse. Dud, still a little dazed by
the suddenness of the triumph, stood a moment beside
the pitcher’s box ere he turned toward the
bench. Then Guy Murtha was with him, had him
by the arm and was laughing softly and saying extravagant
things that he probably wouldn’t have
said five minutes later. But Dud didn’t altogether
sense them. He only knew during the ensuing minute
that Nick had saved him—and the game! And
if he could have done what he wanted to do he’d
have embraced that youth on the spot. As it was,
ignorant that some of the applause was really meant
for him, he made his way to the bench and sat down
a bit breathlessly, and someone was waving a dampened
towel in front of him and there was much talk
and laughter.</p>

<p>And so Grafton started her half of the seventh
with the score still 1 to 0 and Ayer at bat. Ayer
popped innumerable fouls into all sorts of out of the
way places and then, with two strikes and one ball
against him, stood inertly by and let a perfectly good
straight one pass. He shook his head dejectedly
as he turned away. Boynton reached first on second-baseman’s
questionable error—the Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
scorer gave Boynton a hit—and went to second a
moment later when Jimmy was thrown out at first.
Gordon brought the inning to an end by fouling out
to third-baseman.</p>

<p>Then Dud was back in the box again and Gordon
was shouting one thing and signaling another and
again the Lawrence coachers were doing their level
best to rattle him. But that first of the eighth was
easy work for Dud. The luck was all Grafton’s.
The first of the enemy beat out a bunt and then
was caught by Gordon going to second. Dud scored
his second strike-out on the next man, using just four
deliveries. The succeeding batter proved more troublesome,
for after Dud had worked two strikes
across he began to lay against the others and foul
them off with a fine impartiality. Everything, it
seemed, was fish that went to his net, and Dud was
beginning to despair of ever getting rid of him. He
slipped up once and sailed one over the stubborn
batsman’s head, and added a second ball to the
score. Then, however, Gordon signaled a low curve
and this time the ever-ready bat missed! So did
Gordon, for that matter, but he found the rolling
sphere and got it to Ayer well ahead of the runner.
Dud got a round of applause all to himself this time,
as he went back to the bench to pick out his bat, but
he was so busy wondering just how much of a fool
he would look when he stood up there and tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
hit the redoubtable Fairway that he didn’t even hear
it.</p>

<p>I’d like to tell you, in view of what occurred later,
that Dud picked out one of Fairway’s slants and
drove it across River Street for a home-run. But
nothing of that sort happened, and if Dud didn’t
look like a fool at the bat on that occasion it was
only because pitchers aren’t supposed to be hitters.
Dud was an easy proposition for the rival twirler.
He promptly forgot everything he had ever learned
about batting and swung wildly at the first two offers,
held himself away from temptation at the third one
and fanned the air an inch above the succeeding ball.
He returned to the bench shame-facedly, but no one
paid any attention to his fiasco and it dawned on him
that he had done just what they had expected him to
do and a great big determination arose in him to
do better the next time, to learn how to judge a ball
rightly and to eventually become that rara avis
of baseballdom, a pitcher who can hit! But there
was, it proved, no second chance for him today.
Nick Blake fanned as effectively if not as promptly
as Dud had and Bert Winslow was thrown out at
first. And the ninth inning began.</p>

<p>Once more Dud proved his mastery of the enemy,
but there were no strike-outs for him this time. The
first Lawrence batsman hit to Winslow and went out
at first, the next man flied out to Ordway and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
third, after Dud had put two strikes across, lighted
on a low curve and popped it unexpectedly into short
right for a base. Dud made three attempts to catch
him napping and failed and the next minute the runner
was sliding to second ahead of Gordon’s hurried
throw. But Lawrence got no further, for the
following batsman, trying hard to hit safely out of
the infield, merely succeeded in smashing a liner into
Ayer’s hands.</p>

<p>Once more Grafton swung her bats and tried to
break the deadlock. The heat was moderating now
and long shadows were creeping across the diamond,
but the players of both sides were fagged and wilted
and prayed for the end of the contest. But it wasn’t
to come yet, for Ordway fanned, Murtha flied out
to left field—it would have been a wonderful hit if
that fielder hadn’t raced back like a rabbit and made
a one-hand catch that brought applause even from
the Grafton adherents—Ayer beat out a bunt and
Boynton hit a weak grounder to shortstop and the
ninth had passed into history.</p>

<p>Dud was back at his post again, a little tired, too,
in spite of the fact that he had worked only two innings.
He had the head of the list against him now
and realized that this was no time for slip-ups. Lawrence
began enthusiastically. The little, blond-headed
second-baseman outwitted Gordon and Dud
and walked to first. The next batsman fouled out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
to Ayer. Then came a sharp <em>rap</em> and the ball sailed
over second base and there were two on and only
one out. But things looked better a few minutes
later, for Dud scored his third strike-out, turning
the left-fielder ignominiously back to the bench.
That surely ought to have ended things for all practical
purposes, but right there Luck took a hand in
the game. The next batsman was anxious to hit,
and Gordon knew it. In consequence the latter signaled
high ones and Dud tried to serve them up.
They caught him on the second for a strike, after
the first had gone as a ball, and then Dud fooled
him with a low one that barely crossed and the
score was two-and-one. It seemed all over but the
shouting and Gordon risked all on the next delivery.
One finger was the signal and Dud sped the fast one
in breast-high with not a thing on it but steam. The
batsman leaned against that nice ball and drove it
far and high into right field and although Boynton
was under it he missed the catch. And although
he recovered it quickly and sped it back to second,
and Guy Murtha pegged it on to third, the runner
there was safe and the chap who had hit took
advantage of the play and slid to second unchallenged.</p>

<p>Lawrence caught hopefully at the chance before
her. A pinch hitter took the place of the center
fielder. Gordon had no line on the new man and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
had to guess his tastes. A high one was refused
and was judged a ball, a curve that just didn’t cut the
outer corner went as another ball. Gordon signaled
for a drop and the batter bit at it and had one
strike against him. Then another drop failed to
please the umpire and Dud was in the hole. Gordon
called for a high one over the plate and Dud
tried to put it there. But he didn’t. The ball went
wide and Dud saw with dismay the batsman trotting
to first and heard the triumphant yelps of the enemy.
Another pinch hitter was up and Gordon, a little
anxious of countenance now, was asking for a curve
ball. Dud responded and scored a strike, the batter
hitting hard but uselessly. Then came a ball,
then a second. Gordon was calling all sorts of encouragement.
Guy Murtha came over and told Dud
to take his time. His teammates were assuring him
that he could do it. The enemy’s coachers, back of
first and third, were howling and dancing like Comanche
Indians. The runners were running back
and forth along the paths. Pandemonium was fairly
loose and the din thumped against Dud’s ears excruciatingly.
He felt his courage ebbing out of his
finger-tips. He wanted to ask Murtha to let him
quit, to put someone else in, but was more afraid to
do that than he was to go on. Gordon was pleading
for a straight one. Dud glued his eyes to the catcher’s
chest, took his half wind-up and sped the ball.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
And even as he released it he knew that he had
failed again!</p>

<p>“<em>Ball—three!</em>” called the umpire through the din.</p>

<p>Gordon was hurrying down the alley toward him,
shaking the ball at him, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“Settle down!” he growled. “Put ’em over!
You can do it! Now get on to yourself!”</p>

<p>Dud took the ball, nodded dazedly and turned
back to the mound. Murtha was there, Murtha and
Winslow, too, and the captain was looking over past
third base and juggling a pebble in his dirt-grimed
hands. When he turned his gaze sought Dud grimly.</p>

<p>“Guess you’d better let someone else in, Baker,”
he said. “Sorry, but we need this, old man.”</p>

<p>Dud passed him the ball, tried to say something,
he didn’t know what, and turned, white-faced and
with hanging head, toward the bench.</p>

<small>JIMMY ENCOURAGES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That game with Lawrence Textile went to
thirteen innings and ended, still a tie, 1 to 1,
to allow the visitors to get their train.
Nate Leddy, going to the rescue with three on, two
out and the pitcher’s score one-and-three, pulled out
of the hole very neatly. Instead of attempting the
difficult feat of striking the batsman out, Nate
dropped one over knee-high and the ball went
straight up from the swinging bat and straight
down again into Gordon’s mitten, and Lawrence
saw her golden opportunity vanish. After
that for three innings, although the suspense kept
up every moment, neither side got anywhere near a
score. Leddy and Fairway, the latter showing fatigue
and substituting control for speed, were masters
every minute. Fairway’s work to the very end
was such that the spectators applauded him every
time he left the mound or went to bat. After
that hair-raising, nerve-racking tenth inning, Grafton
could feel only satisfaction at the outcome.
Even Captain Murtha had no regrets, and if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
Coach Sargent was disappointed he made no sign.</p>

<p>Perhaps, aside from the Lawrence players, the
only disconsolate one was Dud. He had hurried
from his shower straight to his room, his main desire
being to get out of the way before the game ended
and the fellows came piling into the Field House,
and so he didn’t learn the outcome of the contest
until Jimmy arrived, half an hour later. By that
time Dud’s common sense had come to the rescue
and he was able to review his performance in the
pitcher’s box without being prompted to suicide.
After all, he had fared no worse than Gus Weston,
he told himself comfortingly, and even Ben Myatt
had begun distributing passes before he had been
taken out; although, of course, Ben had far more
excuse for giving out, since he had pitched six innings.</p>

<p>Dud was still wondering what had happened to
him. He had been all right until Boynton had made
that memorable muff. After that he hadn’t been
able to get the ball where he wanted it. It wasn’t
that his arm had tired. It had been just as good
as when he had started. And, as Dud recalled it
now, he hadn’t been nervous; not, anyway, until he
had issued that first pass in the tenth. It just seemed,
looking back on the fiasco, that the ball had suddenly
simply refused to go where it was sent! He
wondered whether Mr. Sargent would ever give him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
another chance, whether the fellows were secretly
laughing at him. Well, he had surely afforded Bert
Winslow a fine opportunity to say “I told you so!”
Bert had all along been politely contemptuous of
Dud’s ambition to make the first team, although of
late he had been very decent to him indeed. He
rather hoped he wouldn’t run across Bert for a day
or two!</p>

<p>Dud didn’t make the mistake of feeling himself
disgraced, at least not after the first few miserable
minutes, but he did feel that he had failed pretty
badly as a pitcher, and that before the whole school,
and he dreaded having to face the fellows again.
He was pondering the idea of remaining away from
dining-hall that evening when Jimmy came tramping
along the corridor and entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, you! Where’d you get to?” Jimmy
skimmed his cap to the bed and threw himself tiredly
into a chair. “Did you see the game out?”</p>

<p>Dud shook his head. “What—what was the
score?” he asked dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Just the same as when you ducked; one each.”
Jimmy gave a brief but graphic history of the final
three innings. “Why didn’t you come back and see
the rest of it?” he concluded.</p>

<p>“I guess I would have if I’d known they weren’t
beating us. I’m glad they didn’t. Did—did anyone
say anything?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“Say anything? What about?”</p>

<p>“About me, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s what’s worrying you? I thought you
looked a little bit down-hearted. Don’t you let that
bother you, son. They all have to go through with
that before they arrive. You did pretty well, on
the whole. Three strike-outs, wasn’t it? And then
you pulled us out of that hole in the seventh! Don’t
be a clam, Dud. No one expects a green pitcher to
go into a game like that and twirl like a veteran.
Why, the row those fellows kicked up even made
<em>me</em> nervous, away out in the field!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that,” said Dud sadly. “I don’t know
what it was. Of course, I was rattled just at first,
but afterwards I didn’t pay any attention to the
noise. I guess Mr. Sargent thinks I’m a pill!”</p>

<p>“Rot! I’ll bet you lasted longer than Pete expected
you to. Of course, I’m not saying that it
wouldn’t have been a bully thing for you if you’d
gone the distance; you’d have had the whole school
inviting you to dinner; but you did pretty well as it
was. And, say, talking about that—being popular,
I mean, and making a hit—that little meeting with
Hobo and Blake was a lucky thing for us, wasn’t it?
Look at the way they’ve taken you up, Dud! Fine,
what?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed the other rather listlessly.
“They’ve been awfully nice to me——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“You bet! And a lot of their crowd, too. Why,
say——”</p>

<p>“But I don’t, somehow, care so much about being—being
a ‘regular feller’ as I did, Jimmy. I—I’d
rather be a good pitcher.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that human nature?” demanded Jimmy, apparently
of the ceiling. “Just as soon as a fellow
gets what he wants, he doesn’t want it! You make
me tired, Dud! Here I’ve schemed and labored
for you——”</p>

<p>“I know, and I’m awfully much obliged,” said
Dud soberly. “Only—please don’t do it any more,
Jimmy. I’ve had enough of it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“My dear demented friend, you’ve just started!
You mustn’t think that just because Hobo Ordway
and Nick Blake and Bert Winslow and a few of that
close corporation have taken you up that the battle’s
won. Far be it from such! The fun’s only started,
son. You’ve got two years here yet and you want to
make hay while the sun shines. Just you leave it
to me——”</p>

<p>“No, you leave it to me now,” said Dud. “I
guess it’s like Blake said; every fellow must hoe his
own row. And—and I haven’t got time to—to be
popular, Jimmy. I just want to get so I can pitch
like Ben Myatt.”</p>

<p>“Say, that’s hitching your wagon to a star, all
right; Ben being the ‘star’! Maybe you’re right,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
though. There’s always the danger of having fellows
think you’re trying too hard; and they don’t
like that. Maybe your scheme is the best, Dud.
Foxy, too, I call it.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any scheme,” denied the other impatiently.
“I just want to quit thinking anything
about whether fellows like me or don’t like me. I
guess if they do it will be because—because I don’t
care!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m saying,” said Jimmy, grinning
exasperatingly. “Just let them think you don’t care
a fig and they’ll flock to you. Yep, that’s a good
idea, Dud.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy, if folks didn’t know you better they’d
think sometimes that you were a regular—regular——”</p>

<p>“Feller?” asked Jimmy helpfully.</p>

<p>“Bounder!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Thank you kindly. And such is gratitude!
Never mind, son, all you need is food. Let’s
get to it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think—that is, I’m not very hungry——”</p>

<p>“Not hungry! You’re not sick, are you?” Dud
shook his head. “Then what’s wrong with you?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know,” replied the other desperately,
“I—I don’t want to go over there and see
the fellows grinning at me.”</p>

<p>“Grinning at you? What would they be doing——<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
Say, for the love of lemons, Dud, get that
idea out of your bean! Why, no one’s grinning at
you, you three-ply chump! Why should they?
Didn’t you go in there and save our bacon for us?
Didn’t you work three innings like a regular
‘Matty’? Sure, you did! Then what——”</p>

<p>“And I went to pieces, too, and filled the bases
that time,” said Dud bitterly. “Even if they don’t
grin I shall know they want to!”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Honest, Dud, I didn’t know you were
such a chump. Look here, you’ve been wondering
again! Don’t tell me! I can see it. You’ve got
your ‘I-wonder’ expression on! You stop thinking
about Dud Baker and wash your dirty face and
hands and come to eats. I’ll guarantee that you
won’t get grinned at once, old man. If I see any
fellow trying it I’ll punch his head!”</p>

<p>After all, Dud only wanted to be reassured and
had no real intention of missing his supper, for he
was undeniably hungry. And so, presently, they
were off to dining-hall together, and things were
just as Jimmy had predicted. There were no grins,
save an occasional friendly one, and no one paid
much more attention to Dud than usual. They
slipped into their places at table—neither had been
called to the training table yet, since accommodations
at that board were very limited—and Jimmy, in
high spirits, bandied remarks with the others between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
mouthfuls, and Dud tried hard to forget anything
that had happened since luncheon.</p>

<p>There was, naturally, much talk of the game and
much criticism of various plays, as there always was,
and Jimmy, as a participant, was listened to with
respect if not with entire credence. At the training
table, across the hall, there were no signs of depression,
if one could judge by the talk and laughter.
In fact, the whole school was looking back on the
afternoon’s contest as something very much like a
lucky victory. And perhaps it was. At all events, a
comparison of the scores showed that Lawrence had
made more hits and fewer errors and that the renowned
Mr. Fairway had behaved more creditably
than the four Grafton pitchers judged together.</p>

<p>When Dud and Jimmy left the dining-hall they
ran into Nick Blake and Bert Winslow in the corridor.
Dud had determined to avoid any such
meeting, but fortune ruled otherwise.</p>

<p>“Hello, James T.,” greeted Nick. “How’s Tris
Speaker Junior tonight? Hello, Dud Baker.”</p>

<p>“My arms are a trifle lame,” responded Jimmy.
“When a fellow makes all the hits in a game——”</p>

<p>“Hah!” ejaculated Nick mirthlessly. “Again,
hah! You make me laugh, Jimmy. He’s a regular
funny fellow, isn’t he, Dud? How are you feeling,
by the way? Say, that was some twirling you did
in the seventh, my lad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“How about the tenth?” asked Dud, smiling
wanly.</p>

<p>“Well, no harm done, you know,” said Nick
cheerfully. “They all get theirs sooner or later,
and I dare say if you’d stayed in you’d have pulled
yourself out all right.”</p>

<p>“If we hadn’t needed the game so much,” observed
Bert, “he’d have stayed in, I guess. I was
hoping Guy would let him. It’s a bully good thing
for a pitcher to have to dig his way out, Baker. Gives
him confidence, you know. If I was captain of a
team and a pitcher got in a hole I’d just let him stay
right there and crawl out of it. Just let him have
to do it, and if he’s the least bit of good, he will.
My notion is that if a pitcher thinks he’s going to be
relieved any time he goes bad, he’s going bad too
plaguey often! That sound like sense to you,
Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard a word that sounded like sense
since I got here,” answered Jimmy gravely. “If
someone would suggest something to do more exciting
than hearing Lit and Forum jabber over some
subject like: ‘Resolved: That Marcus T. Cicero was
faster on the bases than his brother Quint,’ or ‘That
the Penguin is mightier than the Swordfish’!”</p>

<p>“That’s so, it’s debate night, isn’t it?” said Nick.
“Who’s going? You, Bert?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. You?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Well, if there was anything better——!”</p>

<p>“There’s a moon,” said Jimmy tentatively.</p>

<p>“Go on, pray! Your words interest me
strangely,” prompted Nick, assuming an attitude of
suspense.</p>

<p>“And there’s a river——”</p>

<p>“I get you! Will you go, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Bathing? I guess so. Let’s find Hugh. You’ll
come, Baker?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I’ve got——” Dud stopped
abruptly. Jimmy, smiling sweetly, had surreptitiously
kicked him on the shin.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll come,” said Jimmy. “As this happens
to be a Saturday night, Dud, your excuse of having
to dig Latin or something is very poor. Let’s find
a crowd, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not,” said Bert. “I’ll round up Hobo and
Ted Trafford. They went off a minute ago. That’s
enough. By the way, though, I suppose you fellows
know that the rules forbid it?”</p>

<p>“No, honest?” Jimmy was evidently as pained as
he was surprised. “Did you know that, Nick?”</p>

<p>“News to me, Jimmy! I was never so surprised
in my life! Are you sure of what you tell us, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the dickens! Come on then before
the moon goes down.”</p>

<p>“Or the river evaporates,” added Jimmy. “I’m
going to suggest, fellows, that we avoid publicity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
as much as possible. The last time I had anything
to do with that old river it nearly got me into trouble!”</p>

<p>I feel that I ought to record here that Dud’s conscience
made itself heard, and that, refusing to
transgress the rules of the school, he persuaded the
others to forego the enterprise. I’d like to record
that, but I can’t, for Dud’s conscience must have
been asleep, and ten minutes or so later he was following
the others—and Pop Driver, who had been
discovered in the company of Hugh and Ted Trafford
and persuaded to join the party—across the
Green and Lothrop Field to the Beach, as the scanty
expanse of sandy shore bordering the Cove was
somewhat ironically called. And I am forced to relate
that the moonlight bathing party was a huge
success, that it lasted until nearly ten o’clock and
that faculty remained forever in ignorance of it. So,
it would seem, for once the transgressor went unpunished.
But perhaps not, after all, for Nick cut his
foot open on a mussel shell or a piece of glass and
Ted Trafford caught an awful cold that lasted him
nearly until school closed! Possibly the reason that
the others escaped retribution was just because their
crime was not, after all, especially wicked.</p>

<small>ON THE MOUND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dud wondered—Jimmy wasn’t there to stop
him!—what Mr. Sargent would say to him
on Monday regarding that performance of
his in the Lawrence Textile game. As a matter of
fact, Mr. Sargent said absolutely nothing, either
then or at any other time. There was very light
practice that afternoon, most of it batting, and the
fellows were dismissed early, many of them returning
after changing to the practice diamond to watch
the second team put away the Grafton High School
nine. It wasn’t a vastly exciting affair, however, for
the second, with Joe Kelly pitching, had things about
its own way. Dud and Jimmy departed at the end
of the seventh inning, leaving the home team five
runs to the good, and spent a half-hour on the river
in Nick Blake’s canoe. (Jimmy asked permission
when they returned, and so that was all right!)
Jimmy was troubled today and made Dud his confidant
as they paddled slowly along under the drooping
boughs. His trouble concerned Starling Meyer.
But we’ll let Jimmy tell it in his own inimitable way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“Someone,” said Jimmy morosely, “has told Star
he could play baseball. Huh! That’s all right,
too, but what’s the use of making me let go the second
and then dumping me in just when the fun begins?
How do I know I’ll be dumped? Well, I
don’t, I suppose. But, listen, if that chap keeps on
butting in where’ll I be? Ordway and Boynton and
Parker are sure of the outfield places unless they
break a leg or a neck or something. Well, sure,
that’s O. K.; they’re better than I am. I know that.
The only chance I get is when one of ’em is out of
the game. One of ’em’s likely to be out now and
then and so I get a whack. All right, say we. But
here comes this—this Indian, Meyer, butting in and
snooping around for the crumbs, too. That makes
two of us; three, if you count Ben Myatt; and Pete’s
likely to put Ben in center or right any chance he
gets because Ben can bat like a whale! If Star
Meyer’d mind his own business, which is playing
hockey and running creation, I’d have a fair chance
to get into one of the Mount Morris games, wouldn’t
I? Sure, I would! Parker isn’t very spry on that
game leg of his, and I’ve noticed that Boynton is
looking sort of like a friend of mine looked before
he went into a decline. And Hobo might fall out
of his canoe any day and get drowned—if he’d only
use it more. I must suggest it to him. He doesn’t
get enough exercise. Why the dickens can’t Star<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
keep out of it? That’s what I want to know. Something
told me away last winter that I’d have trouble
with that galoot before the year was over!”</p>

<p>“I thought I was the one,” said Dud slyly.</p>

<p>Jimmy grunted. “So did I. Well, anyway, one
good thing is that faculty hasn’t forbidden <em>me</em> to
take a fall out of him!”</p>

<p>“But you can’t very well thrash a fellow for just
playing ball, Jimmy!”</p>

<p>“I can beat him up for interfering with my affairs,”
responded the other with dignity. “Bet you
anything you like he will work around Guy Murtha
and Guy’ll take him along to Corliss day after tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Parker will be back by then,” suggested
Dud.</p>

<p>“Parker? Oh, I dare say. But, listen, Dud, between
you and me now, I don’t believe Parker stands
awfully high with Pete. I wouldn’t be surprised if
he didn’t get back again; regularly, I mean. And
if he doesn’t, why, maybe little Jimmy T. Logan
will have a chance, eh? That is, if Meyer doesn’t
persuade Guy that he’s a ball-player beforehand.”</p>

<p>“You’re hitting better than Star, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“N—no, I don’t think so. Wish I were! Still, I
get my base a heap oftener. I suppose shooting at
hockey helps Star hit the ball. Say, do you know,
Dud darling, I’m going to be sort of peeved and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
disappointed if I don’t get into one of those Mount
Morris games? I wasn’t awfully keen at first, as
you know, but now that I’ve started I’d like to make
good. Besides,” he added gloomily, “the family’ll
be here for that second game and I’d feel like an
awful chump if I had to swing my legs on the bench
all the afternoon!”</p>

<p>“You’d be in good company,” said Dud.</p>

<p>“Meaning you?” asked the other, as he turned
the canoe back toward home. “Oh, you’ll get your
chance, Dud. Mount Morris has got some hitters,
they say, and if she has neither Myatt nor Nate
Leddy will last the games through. As for Brunswick,
I guess he’s a goner for this year.”</p>

<p>“There’s Weston, though.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, too. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised to
see Gus turn around and pitch a corking game some
day soon. I guess the trouble with Gus is that he’s
too temperamental. He and I are alike that way.
If the weather isn’t just right or the moon’s in the
wrong quarter or the tide’s too high or his shoe
pinches him, Gus can’t pitch a little bit. But some
day all the signs are going to be just right, and Gus
will slip on a pair of old shoes, and he will go out
there and make ’em eat out of his hand.” Jimmy
paused. Then: “Maybe,” he added cautiously,
“you can’t tell about Gus. Like me, he has the artistic
temperament.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Dud, after a long silence and as they
swung the canoe into the Cove, “I hope you get into
all the Mount Morris games, Jimmy, and do finely.
And I hope,” he added wistfully, “that they let me
pitch an inning or two in one of them. I—I’d like
that.”</p>

<p>“And I,” responded Jimmy, “hope as how you
gets your hope! Easy on! Let her run, sonny!”</p>

<p>It looked the next day as though Jimmy might
be right about Gordon Parker, for although that
youth was back for practice with his leg evidently
as useful as ever, he did not get back into the outfield
when the first and second lined up for the practice
game. Instead, Boynton played in right, Jimmy
in center and Ordway in left until the fifth inning,
when Star Meyer took Jimmy’s place, much to that
youth’s disgust. Leddy and Weston pitched that
afternoon. Ben Myatt had been more affected by
the heat on Saturday than he or anyone else had
suspected at the time, and was said to be nursing
himself for the next day’s game with Corliss College.
Save for pitching to the batters in practice,
neither Dud nor Brunswick did any work that afternoon.
Dud watched the game from the bench and
listened, during the last two innings, to Jimmy’s
frank expressions of hurt feelings. Every time a
fly ball went into center field Jimmy watched it hopefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Hope he muffs it! Hope he mu—— Isn’t that
rotten luck? Anyway, that’s a bum throw-in! If
I couldn’t do better than that—sometimes—I
wouldn’t try to get an honest man’s job away from
him. Say, you’re next, Churchill. Knock a long one
into center, will you? Put it about fifty feet over
Meyer’s head, like a good fellow!”</p>

<p>But in spite of Jimmy’s hopes and criticisms Star
played a good enough game in center and managed
to get a rather lucky hit the only time he went to bat.
Jimmy tried to bribe Manager Barnes to score it as
an error for the second team shortstop, but failed.</p>

<p>There was an early and rather hurried dinner for
the players the next day and the team, eighteen
strong, bowled away to the station shortly after one
o’clock. Much to his surprise, Dud made one of
four pitchers to accompany it, and Jimmy, too, was
of the number. Jimmy’s satisfaction, however, was
somewhat spoiled by the presence of Star Meyer.
Parker was left behind. So, too, was Ben Myatt,
still suffering from what the school physician had
diagnosed as “a touch of heat.” Ben was instructed
to keep out of the hot sunlight and, when playing,
wear a fold of paper inside his cap. Mr. Sargent,
however, had no intention of allowing Ben to pitch
again until he was so far recovered as not to require
that paper. The first of the series with Mount
Morris would be played on Saturday, just three days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
later, and so Ben had been instructed to stay right
at home and be very, very good to himself. Leddy,
Weston, Brunswick and Dud would undoubtedly
manage between them to dispose of Corliss, for
Corliss, although called a college, was little more
than a preparatory school and was not considered
dangerous.</p>

<p>Corliss lay an hour and forty minutes away by
railroad, although the actual distance was about
thirty-eight miles. The team had to change at Needham
Junction first and, later on, at North Taunton,
and in consequence was somewhat weary when it
finally disembarked from the trolley car that had
brought it from the Corliss Station to the nearest
point to the school. They paraded up a tree-shaded
street, past some yellow-brick building that looked
uncomfortably hot and glary today, and eventually
reached the field, a very ambitious affair, inclosed
with a brick wall and containing a permanent stand
of concrete and a picturesque building of the same
material roofed with red tiles. The fellows secretly
admired that field, but they pretended to consider it
too dressy and made a good deal of fun of the
commodious and well-appointed building into which
they were shown. There they had a room all to
themselves and three shower baths as well. By the
time they had changed to playing togs the stand
was well sprinkled with spectators and a welcoming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
cheer greeted them as they took the field for practice.
Only some dozen and a half Graftonians had
accompanied the nine, for examinations held many
at school and others were too poor to pay for the
trip. But the handful of patriotic youths gathered
themselves into a small but devoted group in a corner
of the big stand and from the first appearance
of the Scarlet-and-Gray on the diamond to the end
of the contest made enough noise for thrice their
number.</p>

<p>All four pitchers were set to warm up while the
fielders practiced. Will Brunswick, by this time
reconciled to his fate, went through the motions in
a mechanical fashion, but the other three set to work
hard, each hoping to get the call. After the Corliss
players, a rather hefty lot of blue-stockinged and
blue-sleeved youths, had taken the field and completed
their warming up, Mr. Sargent had a consultation
with Guy Murtha and Pete Gordon. Dud
pretended no interest as he sat on the bench between
Hugh Ordway and Neil Ayer, but secretly he was a
very anxious boy. Manager Barnes was getting the
batting order now from the coach and Dud, while
answering a remark of Hugh’s, strained his ears
to hear.</p>

<p>“Blake, Winslow, Ordway, Murtha, Ayer, Boynton,
Meyer”—Dud felt sorry for Jimmy then—“Gordon
and—I’ll give you the pitcher later.” Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Sargent nodded to Nick Blake. “Start it up,” he
said.</p>

<p>Nick went to bat while Mr. Sargent arose and,
after watching the work of the opposing pitcher, a
broad-shouldered and rather slow-moving fellow
named Walters, for a few moments, moved along
and spoke to Nate Leddy. Dud’s gaze followed, although
he tried not to let it. The coach and Leddy
spoke for several moments, their eyes all the while
on the Corliss twirler. At last Mr. Sargent nodded
and Leddy settled back in his seat, turning to his
companion on the left, Boynton, and making a remark
that brought, as Dud saw, a look of surprise
to the face of the right fielder. Mr. Sargent remained
behind the bench, watching Nick Blake trying
to find something useful to him amongst the
slow, wide curves that the blue-legged pitcher
was offering. Nick finally slammed one across
the diamond, but was an easy out, shortstop to
first.</p>

<p>Bert Winslow raised a long fly to left field and
likewise retired and Hugh Ordway, after fouling
off a couple, was badly fooled on a drop and fanned.
As the players arose from the bench to trot into the
field Dud, who had forgotten the coach for the moment,
felt a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Baker, I’m going to let you start,” said Mr. Sargent.
“You’ve pitched to Brooks a good deal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
haven’t you? Would you rather have him handle
you than Gordon?”</p>

<p>“He knows my stuff pretty well, sir,” stammered
Dud. “But it’s just as you say, sir.”</p>

<p>The coach called to Ed Brooks. “You catch
Baker, Brooks,” he said. “Let’s see what you can
do, my boy. Study your batters and watch the bases.
Barnes, put Brooks down for Gordon and Baker
last. All right now, you two. Show what you can
do.”</p>

<p>Dud started for the mound, drawing on his glove,
but Brooks overtook him on the way. “Say, Dud,
don’t let’s slip up on signals, eh?” he said anxiously.
“If you don’t get ’em sing out. And if you use that
side-arm pitch signal beforehand, will you? I’m always
afraid of that getting by me. Lift your cap
in front and I’ll know, see? All right, Dud!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>DUD COMES BACK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dud started out with one idea, which was
to redeem himself. He was pretty sure
that Mr. Sargent would not expect him to
go more than five innings, six at the very most, and
he determined to use every bit of strength and science
he possessed during those six frames, to pitch
himself out if necessary, but at all hazards to show
form. He was nervous at first and showed wildness
with his practice balls, and after that made a bad
start by passing the first man up for Corliss. But
subsequently he settled down nicely, and although
he had no strike-outs to his credit in that first inning,
he allowed no hits, and the runner on first never left
that bag.</p>

<p>Grafton got two hits in the second, one rather
scratchy, but failed to score. Corliss once more got
a man to first on a hit that took a bad bound in front
of Nick Blake and once more watched him die there.
In the third, after Grafton had retired in one, two
three order, Dud began to find his control, and he and
Ed Brooks disposed of the Corliss pitcher and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
first two batsmen on the Blue’s list with no trouble,
Walters fanning, the next man popping a fly to Neil
Ayer and the next being thrown out at first by Bert
Winslow.</p>

<p>Grafton got her first run in the fourth inning.
Hugh Ordway was passed, Murtha sacrificed him to
second and, after Neil Ayer had struck out, Boynton
slipped a fast grounder down the alley between
shortstop and second, and Hugh romped home and
beat the throw by a yard. Star Meyer flied out to
center field.</p>

<p>Dud added speed to science in the last of the fourth
and two of the Blue’s best batsmen fanned wildly,
and the little group of Graftonians in the corner of
the stand cheered themselves patriotically and appropriately
scarlet of face. The succeeding batter
drove a liner into Captain Murtha’s glove and the
fifth inning began.</p>

<p>Ed Brooks allowed Walters to put him in a hole
with the first two deliveries, and then, after disdaining
a couple of wide ones, swung despairingly at a
third and somehow managed to get it on the tip end
of his bat and land it safely behind shortstop. Then
began a fusillade of the Corliss pitcher that ultimately
spelled retirement for that youth. Dud, who had
rolled a weak one down the first-base path and been
an easy out the first time at bat, now tried twice to
bunt and failed. After that there was nothing to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
but take a good healthy swing and try to get the ball
out of the infield. With the score two-and-two, Dud
cut loose and poked a hit past third-baseman that put
Brooks on the third sack and himself on first. Blake
bunted and the pitcher fielded, the latter making
the mistake of holding the ball too long to protect
the plate. When he finally tossed to first he was
too late and the bases were full.</p>

<p>At this interesting juncture Bert Winslow ought
to have stepped into the limelight with a smashing
home-run or a three-bagger at least, but the best
Bert could do was to bounce one away to shortstop
and Brooks was an easy out at the plate. But the
bases were still filled, with only one man down, and
there were cries of “Lift it, Hobo!” “Knock it in
the nose, Hobo!” as Hugh went to the plate. Walters,
showing the strain now, pitched two wild heaves
which his catcher barely stopped and then slipped
one across in the groove. Hugh swung at it but was
too late. A third ball followed and Grafton yelled
exultantly. But again Walters made good, Hugh
not offering. Everything depended on the next delivery,
and as the ball left the pitcher’s hand the
three runners on the paths started away. They need
not have hurried, though, for the ball went low and
wide and Hugh walked, Dud crossing the platter
with the second tally for the Scarlet-and-Gray.</p>

<p>By this time Corliss had two pitchers warming up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
and it was easy to see that Walters’ minutes were
numbered. Captain Murtha brought affairs to the
crisis by landing on the pitcher’s second delivery and
lifting it high and far to right field. It was well
over the fielder’s head, and that youth failed to get
under it. Two more runs tallied and Guy took second.
After that Walters passed Ayer and was
promptly derricked. The new twirler, Hoyt, had
difficulty in getting under way, and before he succeeded
two more hits and as many runs had been
scored. Of the hits Boynton contributed one and
Brooks one. Star Meyer made the second out and
Dud the third, Dud being robbed of a hit by a pretty
running catch of a short fly to center.</p>

<p>The score was 6 to 0 when the last half of the
fifth started and there seemed to be no doubt as to
who owned the game. Dud was beginning to feel
tired, but believed himself fit for another inning, or
two if necessary. But things broke bad at the start.
The first of the enemy to face him showed no eagerness
to hit and before he knew it Dud was two balls
to the bad. Then, although he managed to get a
strike across, he followed with a third ball, and the
final result was that the Corliss youth smashed a hot
liner straight over third base and took two bases on
the hit. The succeeding batsman fouled out quickly
to Winslow. Then Brooks tried to catch the runner
off second and the ball got away from Murtha,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
who took the throw, and the runner reached third.</p>

<p>Dud felt himself slipping then and shot an inquiring
look toward the bench. But Mr. Sargent was
evidently still unworried, for Leddy and Weston
were both there and no one was warming up. Dud
gritted his teeth and went on. The batsman had a
strike and two balls on him when Dud, trying to
break a high one over the inner corner, lost control
of the ball and it went straight for the batter’s head.
But Dud’s shout of “<em>Look out!</em>” was not necessary.
The man at the plate dropped just in time and the
ball sailed past Brooks and brought up at the net,
the runner on third sprinting home.</p>

<p>Murtha and the others did their best to steady
Dud again, and Ed Brooks, walking down to place
the ball in Dud’s hand, said: “That was my fault,
Dud. I ought to have got it. Sorry, old man.
Don’t mind it, though. Let’s have this fellow, eh?”</p>

<p>Dud nodded. It was nice of Brooks to call it his
fault, but of course it hadn’t been anything of the
sort. Dud glanced again toward the bench as he
went back to his place on the mound. He wished
that Mr. Sargent would get his relief ready. He
wondered why he didn’t. He was giving way to a
sort of fright now, although he didn’t show it unless
by the longer time he took to grip the ball and
study Brooks’ signal. About him the infield players
were speaking words of encouragement. The batsman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
had him in the hole. He must make him hit.
But something told him that he was worked out,
that there was no use trying, that today was to be
just a repetition of that other day when he had gone
to pieces there on Lothrop Field with the whole
school looking on!</p>

<p>Brooks had signaled for a straight ball and Dud
tried to pitch it. Instead of being straight, though,
it was a hook, but it crossed the corner of the plate
and the umpire was charitable to Dud. Brooks,
looking anxious, threw it back slowly and again
spread his hands. The little group of Grafton rooters
cheered. Dud, however, took no joy of the
doubtful decision. Luck had aided him that time,
but this time, he told himself, he would surely fail.
And fail he did. The ball passed well inside the
plate and the batsman, staggering away from it,
dropped his bat and trotted down the path. Corliss
was cheering madly now, sensing the fact that the
Grafton pitcher was at last weakening. Guy Murtha
hurried to the box and told Dud to take his time,
to let them hit. Dud muttered agreement, conscious
chiefly of disappointment. He had expected Guy
to take the ball away from him! What, he wondered
almost angrily, was the matter with them?
Couldn’t they see that he was through? Why did
they want to keep him there when he was only making
things worse every minute?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>None out now and a runner on first. The next
batsman didn’t wait for a pass but lighted on Dud’s
first offering and sent it rolling toward third. Dud
and Brooks and Winslow all started for it, but it
was Bert who scooped it up and pegged it to Ayer,
and Bert wasn’t set for the throw and the ball went
a yard away from the first-baseman. The first runner
dashed to third and the next slid into second
base. Dud went despairingly back to the mound to
face the next ambitious blue-legged youth. A hit
meant two more runs for Corliss, he told himself.
Surely then they’d let him go out! But the hit didn’t
come just then. Instead, it was a short fly that left
the bat and Nick Blake ran back and got it safely
and slammed it home. But the man on third didn’t
try to score. Then the hit did come, after Dud by
some miracle had induced the batsman to swing at
two wide balls, and it sped into short center field
and two joyful Corliss runners tallied.</p>

<p>Dud looked inquiringly at Murtha and got only
a “Never mind that, Baker! Go to it!” Then his
eyes sought the bench, and there sat Leddy, hands
in pockets, and Gus Weston chatting unconcernedly
with Barnes over the score-book, and Mr. Sargent,
leaning forward with hands clasped loosely between
his knees and his straw hat pulled over his eyes!
Dud couldn’t understand it at all. Did they want
to get beaten? Couldn’t they see that he was throwing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
the game away, that he wasn’t any good after
all, that he never had been?</p>

<p>“Settle down, Dud!” called Nick Blake. “At a
boy! Let’s have ’em, old top!”</p>

<p>“One gone!” chanted Captain Murtha. “Let’s
have the double, fellows!”</p>

<p>Dud turned desperately to his task again. He
tried to remember what the fellow facing him now
had done before. Struck out, hadn’t he? Or was
he the chap who had smashed out that double?
Well, it was up to Brooks, and Brooks wanted a
drop. Dud tried to catch the runner at first and
failed twice and then pitched to the plate. The
drop was good and the batsman swung at it.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” called Brooks cheerfully. “He
can’t hit ’em, Dud! Right across now. Show him
a good one.”</p>

<p>A wide and low one followed and then another.
Two-and-one now, and Brooks showing three fingers
for another drop. Dud tried it and failed and the
umpire announced “Ball three!” Corliss shouted
and stamped and clapped. Dud had none to waste
and he took all the time he wanted for the next.
But it slanted away erratically and the batsman
tossed his bat behind him and sprang gleefully toward
first, while the runner at that station went on
to second. Murtha came to the box.</p>

<p>“Look here, Baker, what’s the matter with you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Are you trying to present them with the game? For
the love of Mike, put some of them over! Let them
hit ’em, I tell you. We’ll take care of them!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” muttered Dud, “you’d better let me out,
Murtha.”</p>

<p>“Let you out? Is that what you’re up to? Well,
listen, Baker; you’re going to stay in here until you
get the third man if it takes all the afternoon! So
you might as well get busy. You can throw the game
away if you want to, but you’re going to stay right
here, son! Understand that?”</p>

<p>Dud viewed him, astonished. Then he nodded.
“All right,” he said finally. “I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk,” responded the captain kindly.
“Get a grip on yourself, Baker. You’re just as good
as you were an hour ago, man! All you’ve got to
do is to think so! Now settle down and make ’em
eat out of your hand!”</p>

<p>Dud gave up trying to understand things after
that. They meant to keep him at it until he had
retired the side. That was the principal thing to
think of. He wasn’t to look for relief but must
earn his own salvation. Well, in that case he knew
where he stood, and that was something of a comfort.
At least, he wouldn’t have to look over toward
the bench every few minutes. Either they
thought he could hold what he had or they were
just keeping him in to punish him. Either way, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
didn’t much matter, he decided. All he had to do
now was to retire two more batsmen in some way
or other. That realization seemed to simplify matters
remarkably!</p>

<p>Dud turned and studied the bases. A runner on
second and a runner on first. And one out. Why,
that wasn’t so bad! A double play would end the
trouble, or a hit anywhere in the infield would probably
account for one. He mustn’t let the batsman
bunt toward third, though, for that would draw
Winslow off his bag. Better give him low ones and
try the inner corner. If only he could get his slow
ball working again he might squeeze out of the hole
he was in.</p>

<p>“Two fingers,” said Dud to himself. “But that
won’t do, Ed. He wants to dump one down toward
third.” Dud shook his head and Brooks laid three
fingers across his mitt. Dud nodded. Yes, a drop
was the best. If he could make it go, he added
doubtfully to himself. But he did make it go. And
the batsman professed intense astonishment when a
strike was called. Brooks signaled for the same
thing again, and again Dud essayed it, and again he
earned the decision, for this time the batter swung
viciously at it without, however, any result. Dud
breathed easier. With two strikes across he could
waste a couple and perhaps fool the batsman with
a hook. Brooks showed two fingers and Dud served<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
a curve waist-high but wide of the plate. Then another,
a little closer, but still not tempting. Dud
refused two signals and at last got Brooks to show
four fingers. Then Dud nodded, glanced behind
him to where Murtha and Blake were running the
blue-legged youth back to base whenever he tried to
steal a start, and wound up. Forward shot his arm
and away sped the ball, straight for the plate and
fairly high, and around swung the bat and swept
through empty air! For the ball had been a slow
one and the batter had hit inches ahead of it!</p>

<p>Dud stopped slipping then, brought up with a
round turn, in fact! If he could still make that
slow ball of his go right he could fool any of them!
He wondered what had got into him! Why, he was
just as good as ever! What a silly fool he had been
to think anything else! They were shouting shrilly
and triumphantly over in the corner of the stand
and Brooks was grinning all over his round, freckled
face. Dud spread his hand in the dust and fondled
the ball and waited calmly for the next batsman.
He was no longer afraid, no longer doubtful. He
had, he told himself exultantly, come back!</p>

<p>Brooks asked for a curve and Dud refused it. A
fast, straight ball instead was what the batter saw
speed past him. Perhaps, though, he didn’t really
see it, for it fairly sizzled with the “steam” that Dud
put on it. After that a low curve broke badly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
then a second one barely trimmed the outer corner of
the rubber, but the batsman swung at the latter and
missed it. A foul back of the plate just escaped
Brooks and spoiled what Dud had intended for a
third strike. Two-and-two now, and the Corliss
coachers shouting imploringly for a hit and the runners
dancing on their toes, eager to be off. Dud
might still waste one if he liked, but his fingers,
when the ball came back to him, curved themselves
around the ball cunningly in response to the catcher’s
signal and Dud stepped forward and pitched, and
every ounce of speed he had went into that delivery.
Straight as an arrow it flashed to the plate,
cut it squarely in halves and thumped into Ed
Brooks’ mitt. The batter never even offered at it
and his bat was still at his shoulder when the umpire
waved him aside!</p>

<p>Dud, walking across to the bench, heard the
cheers of the tiny band of Grafton rooters and
smiled a little. Those cheers sounded awfully good
to him just then! He had come through and the
only desire in his heart now was to be allowed to
finish!</p>

<p>And finish he did, and went straight through to
the end of the ninth without further punishment.
In those four succeeding innings the enemy made just
three hits, one of them a two-bagger that netted
nothing beyond a journey to second base. Six strike-outs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
were added to his credit and he made two assists.
And in the meanwhile Grafton sweetened her
total with three more runs, so that when Dud ended
the game by causing a Corliss pinch hitter to fly out
to Boynton in left the score stood 9 to 3.</p>

<small>BEN TELLS A SECRET</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The team missed connection at North Taunton
coming back and had to kick their heels
about the platform there for more than an
hour, reaching school finally just before eight, a very
tired lot. There was a cold supper awaiting them
in the dining-hall, and after that had been demolished
few of the fellows had inclination for anything
but bed.</p>

<p>Jimmy, who had remained on the bench all the
afternoon, was in a particularly pessimistic frame
of mind, and Dud’s last conscious memory was of
Jimmy, pajama-clad, seated on the edge of his bed,
muttering dire threats against Star Meyer.</p>

<p>Thursday was a busy day for Dud, with examinations
beginning in real earnest. In the corridor
of School Hall at noon he was hailed by Roy Dresser.
“Say, Baker, Myatt’s looking for you. Told
me to tell you to drop around to his room if I saw
you.”</p>

<p>As there was still a half-hour before dinner, Dud
turned his steps toward Lothrop and climbed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
flight of slate steps that led to the second corridor.
Ben Myatt roomed with Nate Leddy in Number 8,
and both occupants of the two-room suite were in
when Dud entered. He hadn’t seen Myatt for several
days and he was surprised to find him stretched
out on the couch looking rather pale and fagged.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dud,” he said. “Mind if I don’t get
up? I’m feeling a bit rocky today. Pull up a chair.”
Dud replied to Leddy’s greeting and found a seat.
Leddy went on sorting some books at his desk.
“Nate,” continued Myatt, “has been telling me about
your good work yesterday, Dud. I was awfully
glad to hear it, son. How’s the arm today?”</p>

<p>“Quite all right, thanks. Oh, it’s a little stiff, but
I guess it will limber up this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Better go easy with it. Nine innings is quite a
stretch the first time. You’ve never gone the full
limit before, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, and I thought for a while yesterday that I
wasn’t going to be able to. I guess Leddy told you
what a mess I made of that fifth inning.”</p>

<p>Ben nodded. “I wonder,” he ruminated, “how
many of us have had an upset in that ‘fatal fifth.’ It
seems that the fifth is crucial. Anyway, I’ve always
had a sort of superstition about it. If I can last out
the fifth I can go the limit, but almost every game
I pitch something happens in that inning. Sometimes
it’s only a stumble and sometimes it’s a regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
fall-down. I dare say you thought it funny Pete
didn’t pull you out yesterday when you went bad,
eh?”</p>

<p>Dud nodded his head. “Yes, I expected him to,
and when he didn’t I—well, I sort of thought he
was keeping me in to—to discipline me. I suppose
he was.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. We were talking you over the
other evening; I guess it was the night after the
Lawrence game; and Pete said he guessed you
wouldn’t stand a full game this year but that you
might next. I told him you could stand it any time
if he’d let you do it. ‘You put Baker in a game
that’s on ice,’ I said, ‘or a game you don’t particularly
care about winning and let him see himself
through. Every pitcher has got to get into trouble
once and dig out again before he finds himself.
After he has done it once he knows that he can do it
and after that he does it.’ Pete thought I might be
right and Guy said he was certain of it. Great Scott,
don’t I know? Haven’t I been through it? I’ve
stood up there with the crowd yelping and been so
scared I couldn’t half see the plate! Just had to
trust to luck when I let ’em go that they wouldn’t
fly over the backstop! Don’t you feel, now that
you’ve stood the gaff, that you could start out this
afternoon and pitch nine innings without getting
wobbly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I think I could,” responded Dud cautiously.
“But I mightn’t. When a fellow’s stuff stops breaking
right for him and a play goes wrong in the infield
and there are a couple on the bases——”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said Leddy. “I know the feeling,
Baker. It’s the deuce!”</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed Ben. “But what I’m trying
to say is that a chap has got to get good and scared
and get over it before he’s worth a hang in the box.
You had your scare in the Lawrence game, Dud. I
could see just how you felt. But they had to pull
you out to save the game. You had another one
yesterday and they didn’t have to pull you out and
you found it was up to you to crawl out of the hole
all by yourself, and you buckled down and did it.
You didn’t know it, but if we’d been trimmed thirty
to nothing yesterday you’d still been in there pitching
’em over when the game ended! That was
Pete’s plan from the first. ‘If Baker’s in shape,’ he
said to me, ‘I’ll put him in and let him pitch the
whole game.’”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I didn’t know it,” laughed Dud. “I’d
have been frightened stiff if I had!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t have blamed you a mite,” said Nate.
“To tell the truth, Baker, when Pete told me on the
bench there yesterday that he was going to put you
in for the limit I thought he was crazy. I didn’t
expect you to last more than four innings. I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
mind telling you now, because it turned out all right
and you fooled me beautifully. I apologize. You
pitched as nice a game for a rookie as I ever saw in
my life, old man, and that’s a fact!”</p>

<p>“I wish I could have seen it,” said Ben. “Fact
is, Dud, I sort of look on you as a pupil, although I
never really taught you a thing except a little common
sense. You had everything you’ve got now
when I got after you that day in the cage, but——”</p>

<p>“You taught me how to use what I did have,”
said Dud stoutly. “If it hadn’t been for you I’d
never have made good a little bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right. Thanks for the testimonial.
What I wanted to see you about today was this.
Nate and I talked it over and we decided to put you
wise to what’s up. Pete probably thinks it’s better
to keep quiet about it. Anyway, it wouldn’t help
any to let it get over to Mount Morris. So you
keep it to yourself. I’m dished for the rest of the
year, Baker. When I was a kid I had a sunstroke.
A lot of us were on the beach one beast of a hot day
and we were doing stunts and racing and going on
the way kids will, you know. Well, I keeled over
and was sick for two or three days; had rather a
narrow squeak of it, I believe. I’ve never had any
trouble since, though, until Saturday. It was beastly
hot that day, and I guess I was feeling sort of punk,
anyway. Well, the result was that I had to give up,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
and after I got to the Field House I was as sick as
a dog and felt like the dickens. Now the Doc says
I’ve got to keep out of the sun all summer. Oh, he
says there’s no harm in going around if it’s just ordinarily
warm, but I’m supposed to wear some sort
of a ventilated hat or stick a newspaper in it or
something. If the day’s all right I’ll have a try at
twirling Saturday, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be good
for only four or five innings. That means that Nate
here will have to finish out. Or Nate may start and
I’ll go in if it’s necessary. Anyhow, there’s the second
Mount Morris game the next Friday, and, in
case they get one away from us, we’ll have to play
them again the next afternoon. See what I’m getting
at, Dud? You’ve got to take your turn in one
of those games, old man. You can’t figure it any
other way. Gus may get a whack, of course, and if
Gus happened to have a good day it would help the
situation a lot. For my part, I don’t believe we can
count on finishing the series this year in two games.
Mount Morris is good and she’s got a pitching staff
that’s every bit up to ours. So there it is. Nate
will have to pitch part of the Friday game, at least,
and if he does he won’t be up to twirling again the
next day. We want to win the series, naturally, and
we’ve been talking it over. And we decided that it
would be the best thing to put you next to what was
up and let you get accustomed to the idea. I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
know how you are that way, Dud, but I know that
a good many fellows if they were suddenly called on
to go in and pitch in a deciding game with the rival
team would have nerves so badly they wouldn’t
know a drop from a jump.”</p>

<p>Dud took a long breath. “Gee!” he said. “Can
I do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure you can—after yesterday. Yesterday’s
experience was just the sort of medicine you
needed. Don’t you think so yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. At least, I don’t think I’d ever go to
pieces quite so badly again, Ben. But—but pitching
against Mount Morris——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Leddy. “Mount Morris isn’t so
different from Corliss. They play a little better,
that’s all. The big thing is to just go in and tell
yourself, and make yourself <em>believe</em>, that you’re a
heap better than any batsman they can put up. Isn’t
that so, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Yep, I think it is. Confidence is a big factor in
pitching, Dud. And we want you to spend the next
week or so accumulating a lot of it. You’re not
likely to have to work Saturday, although you never
can tell what’ll happen in a ball game. Anyway,
you won’t have to work more than an inning or two.
I’m pretty sure I can go four and Nate isn’t likely
to break down under five, I guess. I wish to goodness
we had one south-paw in the bunch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“Brunswick’s a left-hander,” offered Dud.</p>

<p>“I know, but he isn’t ready yet. I guess he’ll
come around nicely next year. Well, that’s the outlook.
Now, if you take my advice, you’ll do a little
work every day, Dud; not a great deal, but enough
to keep silky; and you’ll get used to the idea of going
into one of those Mount Morris games and doing a
lot of pretty pitching. I’m going to get out of here
tomorrow and we’ll have a try-out, just you and I,
Dud. I want to see that cross-fire of yours again.
If you can make that good it might be a big asset
against some of Mount Morris’ right-handed batters.
How is your hitting nowadays, Dud?”</p>

<p>“Pretty poor, I’m afraid,” replied Dud ruefully.</p>

<p>“Try and brace up with it. You never can tell
when a hit will mean a whole lot to your team. And
a pitcher that can smash out a safety now and then—especially
when it’s needed a lot—is pretty useful.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only thing that got Ben his place,”
said Leddy dryly.</p>

<p>“It helped a lot, anyway,” laughed Ben, “especially
when I started in with the second and didn’t
have much more than my glove. But you try to
meet ’em between now and next Friday, Dud. And,
by the way, better not let Pete Sargent know that
you’re on. Maybe he will give you a hint himself in
a day or two, but until he does you let him think you
don’t suspect anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>But Dud got no hint from the coach that week.
The next day, Friday, Ben lugged Dud off to the
practice diamond after the teams had gone in and
put him through his paces. Dud’s round-arm delivery
interested him considerably, and Ben had to have
a try at it himself, without, however, getting any
such result as Dud did.</p>

<p>“I like that,” said Ben. “If you can make it a bit
more certain, Dud, you’ll have a good ball there. I
know if you pitched that to me and I didn’t know
what was coming I’d back out of the box! Let’s try
it again.”</p>

<p>Dud put in every moment at batting that he could
find opportunity for. But he didn’t seem to make
any improvement. He could land on some of
Brunswick’s offerings fairly well, but Gus Weston
or Leddy nearly always got them past him. He
wasn’t used in the box on Thursday, and had only
two innings of work Friday, but his pitching arm
was back in shape and he assured himself over and
over again that he was quite ready to face Mount
Morris or anyone else. Nevertheless, his heart had
a way of jumping into his throat sometimes when he
suddenly remembered what might happen a week
hence! Jimmy wasn’t much use to him at that time,
for Jimmy was having hard work with examinations
and was, besides, much disgruntled over Mr.
Sargent’s preference for Star Meyer in center field.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
Even when, the day after the Corliss game, he dwelt
on what he termed Dud’s “coup,” he was only half-hearted.</p>

<p>“You own the school now, Dud,” he proclaimed.
“Your middle name is Popularity. Didn’t I tell you
that if you followed my advice and specialized on
pitching a baseball you’d get to be a regular feller?
Sure, I did! And you’ve gone and done it!”</p>

<p>Dud, though, failed to discern any enormous popularity.
Of course those who had seen the game
were warm in their praise of his work, and those
who hadn’t been present looked on him a bit more
interestedly, but if he had expected to wake up on
Thursday and find himself suddenly famous—and,
as a matter of fact, he hadn’t thought of any such
thing—he would have been disappointed. No one
patted him on the back and told him how good he
was and no one particularly sought the honor of his
society. But the Corliss contest had not been a very
important one and the school had fully expected to
win it, anyway. Real fame was to be garnered only
in a game with Mount Morris.</p>

<p>Saturday dawned hot and breathless, with an unclouded
sky overhead. There were no examinations
that morning and the fellows had nothing to do but
look forward to the afternoon’s contest with their
old rival and speculate on the outcome of it. A
few heroic ones played tennis and the canoes were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
pretty busy, but the heat made idleness almost a
virtue. It was rumored at dinner time that Leddy
would start in the box for Grafton and that Myatt
would be held in reserve.</p>

<small>THE FIRST GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When, at two o’clock, the invading hordes
swept down on Grafton it looked as
though Mount Morris Academy had arrived
in toto. Of the hundred and eighty-odd students
enrolled at the Greenbank school that year,
fully a hundred and fifty swarmed over from the
station after the arrival of the train. They came
in hilarious mood, marching along Crumbie and
River Streets four abreast and waving small green
megaphones through which they hoped to later roar
the enemy into subjection. Green and white, the
Mount Morris colors—I am aware that white is not
a color, but how else can I put it?—were much in
evidence in the shape of pennants and neckties and
arm-bands, while a frivolous fox-terrier led the procession,
straining at his leash, attired in a green
blanket with the school monogram in white. Altogether,
that invasion was notable and picturesque,
and Grafton, looking on from the windows of Lothrop
and Trow or from along the campus fence,
cheered approvingly. Mount Morris cheered back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
and waved her pennants, turned into School Street
and disbanded at the gate. Subsequently those who
had acquaintances at Grafton were to be seen climbing
stairways, while others wandered around in critical
survey of the school buildings.</p>

<p>Add some two hundred Grafton fellows and another
hundred sympathizers from the village and
roundabout and you’ll understand that the seating
capacity of Lothrop Field that afternoon was severely
taxed. Politely, but not over-eagerly perhaps,
Grafton yielded the grandstands to the visitors
and townsfolk and found accommodation on the
grass. Only a band was lacking to make the occasion
complete; and I’m not sure that a band would
have had much chance with all that cheering and
singing!</p>

<p>The game started at two-thirty, or, to be exact,
four minutes after the scheduled time. The sun was
pretty hot and what slight breeze crept up now and
then from the river did little to mitigate its ardor.
Nate Leddy began proceedings by slipping a strike
over on the head of the Mount Morris batting list,
and the Scarlet-and-Gray cheered what they were
pleased to consider a good augury. The enemy retired
without reaching first and when the teams
changed places it was seen that Mount Morris, instead
of putting in her best pitcher, Saylor, was going
to use Moulton. Moulton was a left-hander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
and Grafton had taken very kindly to his pitching
last year in the second game of the series. Saylor
was evidently to be saved for use against Myatt.</p>

<p>But it was soon apparent that Moulton had progressed
in the gentle art of pitching a baseball since
the previous season, for Blake and Winslow both
fanned and the best Ordway could do was to fly out
to second-baseman. Save that the cheering and singing
and coaching were in their enthusiasm sufficient
to mark the occasion as one greatly out of the ordinary,
no one would have suspected anything unusual
from the first few innings of the contest. Both teams
played hard but ragged ball, and the rival scorers
had to jot down many errors. And yet, since every
spectator was thoroughly partisan, those scoreless
innings were not without their interest. There were
some brilliant plays by both sides: a running, one-hand
catch by Left-Fielder Porter of the visitors that
deprived Guy Murtha of a two-bagger, a superb
throw to second by Gordon of the home talent that
cut down a green-legged runner, a double by Blake
and Ayer that brought the fourth inning to an inglorious—or
glorious, according to whether you
sported green or scarlet—ending. And the two
pitchers, neither seriously threatened, also deserved
laurels. To offset such commendable incidents, however,
there was a sickening muff of an easy toss by
Murtha at second, the dropping of a foul by Ayer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
after he had it nicely in his hands, the booting of a
hit by Winslow and a “solid ivory” play by Gordon
in the third when he called for a pitch-out and then
pegged the ball over first-baseman’s head when the
runner was half-way to second. And the visitors
made quite as many slip-ups and, I think, more displays
of bad judgment of the kind that count in
results but do not show in the error column.</p>

<p>Leddy met his first batch of trouble in the fifth—the
“crucial fifth,” as Ben Myatt had called it two
days before—when he passed the first man up and
allowed the next to hit safely past Winslow. After
that he struck out the next two batsmen but couldn’t
prevent a run coming over when the following green-leg
popped a Texas Leaguer behind Winslow. Nick
Blake made a valiant effort to get that hit, but the
best he could do was to scoop it up and get the man
at third. Grafton got men to third and second in
her half, but they died there.</p>

<p>That ended the scoring until the seventh, and it
was in the seventh that Leddy gave way to Weston
in the first half, and that the home team put the game
away in the second period. Mount Morris began
by getting a scratch hit that put a runner on first.
The next man tried to sacrifice, but Leddy threw wild
to Blake at second and both runners were safe. A
short fly to left field settled in Hobo Ordway’s hands
and he held the runners. Then Leddy let down and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
passed the next batter on four consecutive balls and
the bases were all occupied with but one out. Leddy
showed nervousness and risked a tally by trying to
catch the runner at second. Only quick work by
Blake sent the man at third doubling back to that
base. With a strike and two balls on the batter,
Nate let go of a wild one and, although Gordon
managed to partly block it, the enemy scored her second
run. Leddy pitched another ball, worked
a strike across and finally passed the batter. It
was then that Gus Weston, who had been warming
up to Brooks for two innings, was hurried to
the rescue.</p>

<p>Gus started erratically by pitching three wild ones
in a row and then settled down and struck out the
green-leg and got a fine salvo of applause from some
three hundred anxious Grafton sympathizers. Another
five minutes of suspense followed, during which
Dud and Jimmy and the other non-combatants sat
on the final two inches of the bench and clenched
their hands and yelled their heads nearly off. In
the end, after the batsman, who happened also to be
Mount Morris’s captain, had three balls to his
credit and two strikes against him and had fouled
off exactly five offerings, a screaming fly to center
field that Star Meyer caught ended the trouble.</p>

<p>But if it ended Grafton’s trouble it only began
Mount Morris’s, for it was that last of the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
that saw the downfall of Moulton, the Green-and-White’s
second-best twirler. Gordon led off with a
sizzling shot to right that the fielder had to take on
the bound and was secure on first. Weston went out,
second to first. Nick Blake tried the first thing that
came his way and bounced it off Moulton’s shins,
advancing Gordon and arriving at first without question.
Winslow came across with a two-base hit to
left that sent Gordon home with Grafton’s first tally
and a minute later Hugh Ordway slammed one
down the third-base line, scoring Winslow and putting
himself on second.</p>

<p>That was enough for Moulton and he disappeared,
a tow-headed youth by the name of Whitten
taking his place. Whitten, though, was easy from
the first moment and hit followed hit, interspersed
by a couple of infield errors, until Grafton had
crossed the platter with six runs.</p>

<p>In the eighth Gus Weston almost produced heart
disease among the home team supporters by passing
the first batsman, hitting the next on the leg and
then committing a most apparent balk and moving
the runners to third and second. Ben Myatt drew
on his glove about that time and moved down the
field with Brooks, but Ben’s services were not needed,
after all, for a weak grounder was pegged home for
the first out and Gordon shot the ball to first for the
second. A fly to Boynton, which he juggled for one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
awful instant and then captured, brought the suspense
to an end.</p>

<p>In the Grafton half of the eighth both Winslow
and Ordway hit safely, Murtha flied out to center,
Ayer got his base on a fielder’s choice that failed to
catch Winslow at third, and the sacks were again
filled and the stage set for a tragedy. But the best
Boynton could do was to pop up an infield fly, and it
was left to Coach Sargent, assisted—very capably
assisted—by one James Townsend Logan, to produce
the appropriate climax.</p>

<p>It was Star Meyer’s turn at bat, but Star had
failed all the afternoon to do more than reach first
on one occasion by virtue of a fielder’s choice. So
Mr. Sargent looked about him for a pinch-hitter.
There was, to be sure, Ben Myatt, but Ben was down
the field gently tossing the ball to Brooks. Perhaps
it was a gleam of eagerness in Jimmy’s eyes that decided
the coach. At all events, Star Meyer, armed
for the struggle, was called back half-way to the
plate and it was Jimmy who jumped to his feet,
seized a bat at haphazard, possibly afraid that the
coach would change his mind if he gave him a chance,
and fairly leaped to the plate.</p>

<p>Jimmy got a fine round of applause and a lot of
advice as to what to do. It was evident that many
of the audience would be satisfied with nothing less
than a home-run, but, on the other hand, the advice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
he got from the bench and the coachers was to “just
tap it, Jimmy!” Jimmy did not so well as the stand
demanded and did better than his teammates advised.
He smote it. He didn’t smite at once,
though. He let Whitten put one straight over that
looked too low to Jimmy and just right to the umpire,
and he let Whitten follow that strike with two
deceitful hooks that looked fine at first and then
didn’t. And then, when Whitten tried to sneak one
over again opposite his knee-pads, Jimmy did his
smiting. Jimmy got that ball on the one square inch
of his bat best calculated to produce results, a square
inch located about four inches from the end, and he
put all his contempt for Mount Morris and Whitten
and, incidentally, Star Meyer, into his swing, and
the ball traveled away with a <em>crack</em> that was heartening
indeed to the three impatient runners, shot over
second-baseman’s upthrust glove, still ascending,
went curving into center field at a place where neither
the guardian of that territory nor his left-hand neighbor
had any chance of reaching it, and finally
dropped to earth to roll joyfully along the sward
pursued by two pairs of agitated green legs!</p>

<p>Need I narrate that all Grafton arose as one and
shrieked hysterical delight? Or that the bases,
filled a scant moment before, were speedily emptied?
Or that Jimmy, finding them empty and having his
choice of any, decided to annex second and then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
urged on by coachers more capable of judging the
demands of the moment, spurned second and set his
heart on third—and would have gone tearing home
if Guy Murtha himself hadn’t seized him forcibly
and thrust him back to the bag? Well, perhaps you
wouldn’t have guessed the latter details, but I fancy
you’d have surmised the others. That hit of Jimmy’s
went down in local history as one of the famous
hits of the national pastime. It wasn’t that it won
the game, for the game was already captured. Had
he struck out Grafton would still have been returned
the victor that afternoon. But there was something
beautifully satisfying about it, one might almost say
artistic. The audience was on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i> for it,
the setting was right to the most minute detail and it
was made when and where it would do the most
good. To be sure, it might have been a home-run
and so scored four tallies instead of three, but I
maintain—and I am supported by Dud and Nick
and Hugh and half the school—that there is nearly
always the element of luck in a home-run, whereas
Jimmy’s three-bagger was a solid, meritorious, honestly-earned
hit as soul-satisfying as any homer ever
lifted over a fence!</p>

<p>Perhaps you think I am dwelling over-long on the
glory of that performance and to the holding up of
the game. But as a matter of fact it ended the game
there and then to all intents and purposes. To be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
sure, Gordon did get to first on a pass, while the
cheering was still going on, but nobody cared, any
more than they cared a minute later when Gus Weston
fanned. Anything that might happen now
would be an anti-climax. The audience was satisfied,
surfeited. Mount Morris had no fight left in
her and went out in one, two, three order in the
ninth.</p>

<p>Subsequently there was chaos and noise and the
sight of numerous scarlet-and-gray-hosed heroes
bobbing about above a sea of joyful faces and open
mouths. And Mount Morris trotted subduedly off
the field, after returning Grafton’s cheer, and was
next seen attired in street clothes being borne in
hacks to the station, a number of rather tired-looking
but still smiling young gentlemen whom Fate
had used unkindly. And yet, as they passed Lothrop
Hall they tossed a final cheer behind, and there was
a grimness and determination in the tone of it that
seemed to say: “Make the most of your triumph,
Grafton! Our turn comes next!”</p>

<small>LEFT BEHIND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Grafton jubilated and made glad. Nate
Leddy spent a sorrowful evening and refused
the comfort offered by his roommate.
Gus Weston was inclined to be talkative about his
share in the victory, but no one took Gus seriously.
Of all those who had taken part in the contest, it
remained to Jimmy Logan alone to be triumphant.
Jimmy triumphed and made no bones about it. I
don’t mean that he went around throwing his chest
out or figuratively crowning himself with laurel and
with bay. Oh, not at all. Jimmy was not self-assertive
in the least. He only smiled when laudation
came his way, and strove to impress others as being
firmly of the idea that what he had done had been
nothing to speak of, absolutely nothing. Only, now
that it had been mentioned, wasn’t it a joke on Star
Meyer? Star hadn’t made a hit in the game and
had fielded—well, anyone knew what Star’s fielding
was like! And then, just when he had a chance to
really do something for himself and the team, Pete
had yanked him away from the plate. Not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
that, in Jimmy’s belief, Star <em>would</em> have done
anything. Probably quite the contrary and otherwise.
Star, he reflected compassionately, must be
feeling rather cheap, eh?</p>

<p>Jimmy fairly haunted Star’s waking hours for the
next day or two. No matter where Star went, there
also was Jimmy, Jimmy with a sympathetic mien and
a sly twinkle in his eye. Star ran across him in corridors,
on the Green, on the Campus, on the field,
everywhere. And, on Sunday afternoon, trying to
find sanctuary in the library, he hid himself behind
an atlas of the world in a secluded corner, only to
hear a few minutes later the sound of footsteps on
the floor and to glance over the top of his book into
the sweetly condoling countenance of Jimmy. Star
dropped the atlas with a mutter of despair and
sought his room.</p>

<p>There were plenty who predicted that Jimmy had
ousted Star from center field, and Jimmy himself
believed that he had, and yet when Wednesday came
around, bringing final examinations to an end and
Yarrow High School to the scene, Jimmy again decorated
the bench and it was Star who ambled out to
center field! And, oh, the chagrin of Jimmy!</p>

<p>There isn’t much to tell of that game. Yarrow
had been selected because she was not calculated to
make hard work for Grafton, and she proved the
wisdom of the selection. Brunswick started in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
box for the Scarlet-and-Gray and lasted three innings
and a third of the next. Then Dud went to the
rescue and stopped the onslaught of the enemy. He
was instructed not to exert himself and didn’t need
to, but, possibly for fear that he might, Gus Weston
relieved him in the eighth. Meanwhile Grafton
kept her plate clean and scored eight runs on her
own account. Except that it kept the players in
form and took the place of a game with the second—which
team, by the way, was at Greenbank receiving
a rather conclusive drubbing from the Mount
Morris second nine—that contest might just as
well have not been played. Yarrow High was not
enough of an opponent to test Grafton’s ability in
any line. But it served to keep the enthusiasm up,
if anything was needed for such a purpose, and
gave the Scarlet-and-Gray something to while away
the time with. The next day was to be Graduation
Day and many fathers and mothers and assorted
relatives and friends were already on hand. The
Glee and Mandolin and Banjo Clubs discoursed in
the Gymnasium that evening and there was a dance
afterwards. The dance, however, was not for the
baseball players, or, at least, only a few numbers
of it, for they were supposed to be tucked in bed at
ten o’clock. Let’s hope that most of them were. I
know, though, that Jimmy wasn’t. Jimmy at that
particular hour was perched rather precariously on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
the footboard of Dud’s bed explaining at great
length and with a fine flow of language his opinion
of Star Meyer and Coach Sargent and Guy Murtha
and all others who in any way represented authority
in baseball affairs. Jimmy wasn’t nearly through
when Dud fell asleep.</p>

<p>Graduation Day dawned fair and only mildly
hot and went, as many had gone before at Grafton
and as many would later. There were the exercises
in the hall at eleven, at which some thirty seniors
received diplomas and some one hundred and eighty
others applauded deafeningly. Several that we
know were among the fortunate young gentlemen:
Ted Trafford, captain of last fall’s football team;
Roy Dresser, Guy Murtha, of present fame; Joe
Leslie, class president; Gordon Parker, Nate Leddy,
Ben Myatt, Neil Ayer, Jack Zanetti, of track and
football renown, and some others doubtless. And—I
had almost forgotten—Pop Driver! Yes, Pop
actually received his diploma at last and bore up
very modestly under the acclaim that almost swept
the roof from the building!</p>

<p>And there was a royal luncheon in dining-hall at
one-thirty, and after that “spreads,” as the fellows
liked to call them, in various dormitory rooms, and
still later, lemonade and sandwiches and cakes set
out on a long table in front of Manning. In the
evening Forum and Lit held their big debate of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
year, and Lit won hands down, and the admiring
fathers and mothers and sisters and aunts and—oh,
all the rest of them, clapped and beamed and were
extraordinarily proud. And then there were more
refreshments and, at last, everyone went home—somewhere.</p>

<p>The exodus began the next morning, but less than
half the students deserted. Most of them, accompanied
by compliant parents, entrained for Greenbank
at eleven-ten or twelve-twenty-five to see the
ball game. At a few minutes after twelve Grafton
was pretty well deserted. Mr. Crump, the worthy
head janitor, remained, I think, and possibly a stray
member of the faculty, but Doctor Duncan went and
“J. P.” went and “Jimmy” Rumford and, oh, just
about everyone! And so we might as well go too!</p>

<p>The team, fifteen strong exclusive of manager
and assistant manager and Mr. Sargent and “Dinny”
Crowley and “Davy” Richards, left on the later
train. A five-minute wait at the junction, spent in
working off a little extra enthusiasm, and then they
boarded the main line train and were hustled away
toward Greenbank and whatever fate awaited them.</p>

<p>Of course most everyone hoped for a second victory
since it would leave them free to go home for
the summer, but there were one or two enthusiasts
who were willing to see the series go to three games.
Among the latter was Dud, for Dud wanted very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
much indeed to pitch in one Mount Morris contest,
and he saw no likelihood of doing it unless that third
game was played. Most of the fellows proclaimed
their belief that Grafton would again take the measure
of her opponent this afternoon, but secretly they
doubted it. Mount Morris had nearly always taken
one game, and today, playing on her own field, surrounded
by her graduation crowd, and smarting under
the defeat of last week, she was certain to make
a fine fight for victory.</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent, Murtha, Barnes and Mr. Crowley
occupied seats together and spent most of the time
between Needham Junction and Greenbank laying
plans for the contest. Dud and Jimmy sat together
further back in the coach, Jimmy doing his best to
make Star Meyer uncomfortable by staring at the
back of his head. There was a good deal of talk
and laughter and some horse-play, for the fellows
had the coach pretty much to themselves until Webster
was reached. There was a delay at Webster,
for a branch line train with which the express made
connection had not arrived. Most of the fellows
disembarked to stretch their legs and harry the station
agent, and Jimmy and Dud were of the number.
Jimmy insisted on taking his stand on the platform
opposite the window at which Star sat and
staring him out of countenance until Dud dragged
him away by main force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet,” chuckled Jimmy as, having promised to
behave, he obtained his release from his chum’s
grasp, “I’ll bet that Star will be glad when he hikes
out for home! I never knew a fellow who disliked
to be looked at as much as he does!”</p>

<p>“Looked at!” said Dud. “You’re enough to
drive the fellow crazy! I wouldn’t be surprised if
he dreams of you at night, you and your—er—bacillus
stare!”</p>

<p>“I think the word is <em>basilisk</em>,” replied Jimmy
sweetly. “Not that it matters, however. Not that
anything matters except whether I beat that chump
out for the position of center fielder today. Say,
where are you taking me? Suppose the train starts
up?”</p>

<p>“It won’t. You heard the trainman say we were
waiting for the local, and that comes in over there
on the other side of the station. Let’s see if there
are any fish in this stream.”</p>

<p>“Who cares whether there are or not?” But
Jimmy followed along the embankment to lean beside
Dud over the railing of the culvert and stare
into the little brook that flowed beneath. “I see a
frog down there, if that will do you any good. I’d
like to catch him and put him down Star’s neck!”</p>

<p>They had wandered some forty or fifty yards
back from the rear car, which the team had taken
possession of, and consequently when a bell clanged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
far down the track and the command “All
abo-o-oard!” reached them, as it did at that moment,
they didn’t waste time in expressing surprise
or consternation but set off as fast as their feet would
carry them.</p>

<p>“That trainman,” panted Jimmy, “will come to a
bad end!”</p>

<p>Whether the conductor failed to see them or
whether he gave them credit for an astonishing
celerity they never knew, but the train began to move
before they had covered half the distance between
the culvert and the last platform of the rear car.
Running over ties is not conducive to speed and for
a moment or two they despaired of reaching their
goal. But they did reach it, just when the end of the
station platform threatened to defeat their efforts,
and Jimmy, leading, grasped a handful of iron railing
and gave a spring.</p>

<p>What happened next was always very confused
in their minds. They had noticed that the rear
platform was occupied by someone, but had not recognized
who that someone was. As Jimmy’s fingers
closed about the railing at the steps a rubber-soled
shoe was placed against his chest and the very next
thing <a href="#i_fp282">Jimmy</a> knew he <a href="#i_fp282">was rolling over on the platform
and Dud</a> was rolling over <a href="#i_fp282">with him</a>, and the
train was rods away!</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp282">
  <img src="images/i_fp282.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_281">“Jimmy ... was rolling over on the platform and
Dud ... with him”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Struggling somehow to his feet, Jimmy gave chase,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
shouting like a wild Indian and causing a stupendous
commotion amongst the few occupants of the platform.
But all he got for his pains was an ironic
farewell wave from the figure in the doorway of the
last car!</p>

<p>Dud, rather pale of face, joined him, dusting his
clothes and staring dazedly after the disappearing
express. Jimmy, wild-eyed, turned sputteringly.</p>

<p>“D-did you see who that was?” he demanded.
“It was Star Meyer! He pushed me off the step!
He—he kicked me off! I might have been killed!
You wait! You wait till I——”</p>

<p>But Jimmy was fairly gibbering now. Dud handed
his straw hat to him. “Never mind about that
now,” he said impatiently. “The question is how
we’re to get to Greenbank. How far is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You wait till I get my hands
on that—that——”</p>

<p>“Let’s find out,” interrupted Dud anxiously. “The
game’s at two-thirty and it must be half-past one
now. Maybe there’s another train that will get us
there in time, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy stopped his mouthings and hurried after
Dud to the waiting-room, unconscious of the curious
regard of the small audience. The agent was
most unsympathetic. He had been chivied by the
fellows and made sport of and he seemed to think
that it served these two young rascals just about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
right. His replies to their anxious questions were
short and discouraging. No, there wasn’t another
train to Greenbank before two-forty-eight. No, he
didn’t know how they were to get there by half-past
two. (His tone implied that he hoped they
wouldn’t!) Yes, they might be able to get a carriage
to drive them over. There was a livery stable
about a mile down the road there. And the distance
to Greenbank by rail was nine miles.</p>

<p>They retired to consider. A mile walk to the livery
stable didn’t appeal to them and Dud suggested
telephoning. Fortunately, there was a booth in the
corner of the waiting-room and Jimmy possessed a
nickel. They crowded in and at last, after much delay,
got the stable. But the voice at the other end
was not at all reassuring. They had carriages enough
and horses enough, but just now there wasn’t anyone
to drive ’em. If they could wait until two
o’clock maybe Billy would be back from Chester.
Jimmy impatiently suggested that they could drive
themselves and the stable could send a man over to
Greenbank on the train to bring the team back. But
that didn’t appear feasible to the man on the telephone.
Mr. Libby, it appeared, had gone to the
city. (Mr. Libby, they gathered, was the proprietor.)
If Mr. Libby was there maybe he’d let
’em have a rig, but the speaker declined to shoulder
the responsibility. In short, the only course was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
await the return of Billy at two—or maybe half-past—or
three, at the latest!</p>

<p>Jimmy hung up the receiver impatiently.</p>

<p>“I suppose there isn’t a trolley?” murmured Dud.
They consulted the agent once more. He showed
peevishness at being required to awake from his nap
and open the window again and took evident pleasure
in informing them that the nearest trolley line
was four miles distant and that it didn’t go to Greenbank,
anyway; leastways, not direct; it went to West
Shoreham first. The window descended with a venomous
bang.</p>

<p>Dud and Jimmy, hands in pockets, wandered disconsolately
back to the platform. There was an
unoccupied baggage truck there and they seated
themselves on it and swung their legs and stared
forlornly at a field of potatoes.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” murmured Jimmy hopelessly.</p>

<p>Dud consulted his watch. It was now one-forty-six.
In three-quarters of an hour the game would
start. And they wouldn’t be there! Of course it
wasn’t very likely that he would have had a chance to
pitch today, anyhow, but there was always the possibility.
Dud sighed deeply and Jimmy echoed the
sigh. It had just occurred to him that there was
now no question as to who would play center field.</p>

<p>“If I ever lay my hands on that skunk,” broke
forth Jimmy, “I’ll—I’ll just about——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>But Dud interrupted by sliding off the truck and
walking away down the platform.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” called Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Greenbank,” answered Dud.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Walk!”</p>

<p>“Walk! Walk nine miles? Why it’ll take hours!”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Dud over his shoulder. “Let
it. But I’m going to get there, just the same,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“But—here, hold on!” Jimmy followed at a trot.
“What’s the use, Dud? We won’t get there until
the game’s ’most over, and——”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it. I started out to see that game
and I’m going to! Besides, a fellow might as well
be walking as sitting around on that platform. I
can do nine miles in two hours, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Two hours! Oh, jimminy!” Jimmy looked
longingly back at the shaded platform.</p>

<p>“What do you say?” demanded Dud. “Coming
along?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Jimmy in a weak voice. “I
don’t see what good it is, but—all right, Dud, I’ll
have a try at it. Nine miles! Gee!”</p>

<p>“Come on then,” said Dud. “Let’s hike.”</p>

<small>THE BORROWED HAND-CAR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was hot and the walking was hard. They took
to the path between the tracks, but even that
was far from being an ideal surface. Now and
then a sleeper, longer than the rest, protruded to trip
unwary feet and for long stretches at a time they
walked over ballast. When they had been on their
way only a few minutes a locomotive whistle sounded
in the distance behind them and Jimmy was for
turning back. It might be, he thought, a train to
Greenbank. But Dud destroyed his hope.</p>

<p>“It’s that branch line train,” he said. “The one
we didn’t wait for.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to push it off the track,” muttered Jimmy.
“If it hadn’t been for that we wouldn’t be in this
fix.”</p>

<p>After another ten minutes conversation ceased altogether.
They were too hot and tired for talking.
The track, with strange perversity, ran for a long
way through a cut and what breeze there was failed
to reach them. They watched eagerly for the mile-posts
at first, but they were unusually far apart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
they concluded, and they soon got tired of looking
for them. A wooden trestle made the going easier
while it lasted, for there were planks to walk on,
but it ended all too soon and they were back on cinders
and broken stone again. Near the end of the
third mile they retired to the ditch at one side to let
a long freight trundle past. Jimmy morosely observed
that, of course, the pesky thing had to be
going in the wrong direction!</p>

<p>They reached a small station at about half-past
two and made an assault on the water tank in the
little room. Perhaps fortunately, the water had not
seen any ice that day. They rested a few minutes
and then went on again. A hundred yards down
the track Jimmy uttered an exclamation and Dud
turned to find him pointing dramatically at a hand-car
reposing on a couple of ties laid at right angles
to the rails at one side of the way.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” asked Jimmy
in awed tones.</p>

<p>“What about it?” asked Dud.</p>

<p>“Why, you chump, all we’ve got to do is slide that
on the track and get to Greenbank in no time at
all!”</p>

<p>“And get arrested for swiping railroad property!”</p>

<p>“We won’t swipe it; we’ll just borrow it,” said
the other indignantly.</p>

<p>“I guess,” responded Dud dubiously, “it’s harder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
to work one of those things than it is to walk. Besides,
we couldn’t lift it onto the rails.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet we could. And all you have to do is just
work those handles up and down like a pump, you on
one side and I on the other. It may be hard, but
it’ll be a mighty pleasant change!”</p>

<p>“We’re certain to get in trouble if we try that,
Jimmy. Come on. We’ve done half the distance,
I guess, already.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” Jimmy was already struggling
with the hand-car. “We can lift it easy enough,
Dud. It isn’t heavy. Here, we’ll toss this junk off.”
And Jimmy ruthlessly slid a box of spikes and some
tools to the ground. “Give us a lift, Dud!”</p>

<p>Dud hesitated an instant longer and then went to
Jimmy’s assistance. The car was lumbersome, but
they had no great difficulty in trundling it along the
ties and then swinging it to the rails. Fortunately,
a bend in the tracks hid them from the little station.</p>

<p>“Climb aboard!” said Jimmy joyfully. “Bend
your back, Dud! Let her flicker!”</p>

<p>She didn’t “flicker” much at first, though, and it
proved to be surely a case of “bend your back”!
They did a good deal of grunting and perspiring before
the hand-car found its gait. After that it
wasn’t hard to keep it going, except that the continual
raising and lowering of the bars soon began
to tire arms and shoulders and backs. But Jimmy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
although the perspiration was soon trickling down
his nose, was full of encouragement.</p>

<p>“There’s another mile-post coming, Dud! Say,
I’ll bet we’re making fifteen miles an hour, eh?”</p>

<p>“More like ten,” panted Dud. “Wish we’d come
to a grade so we could quit a minute!”</p>

<p>“Bound to be one soon, I guess. Keep it up!
We’re doing finely!”</p>

<p>And there was one soon. It began a few rods beyond,
but, instead of being a down-grade it was the
other sort, and for the next ten minutes they had
their work cut out for them! Dud was all for abandoning
the hand-car and taking to their legs again,
but Jimmy pointed out that when they had once
reached the top of the hill they’d be able to coast
down the other side of it. But Jimmy was wrong
about that, for when the grade did come to an end
only a level track awaited them. Still, after propelling
that thing up a quarter-mile rise, even level
track was a vast relief, and they let the car run a
minute while they dropped the handles and mopped
their streaming faces.</p>

<p>“What time is it now?” asked Jimmy, easing a
wilted collar about his neck. They had long since
removed their jackets and hats and bundled them at
their feet.</p>

<p>“Two minutes to three,” answered Dud. “How
much farther is it, do you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“Only about two miles, I guess. Say, suppose we
come to a station? We’ll have to beat it by in a
hurry, eh?”</p>

<p>“Either that or let this thing go. But there isn’t
likely to be another station before Greenbank, I
guess. Let’s hit her up again.”</p>

<p>They hit her up and overtook another mile-post
and were arguing breathlessly as to the distance
they had covered when a sudden roar and clatter
down the track behind them put the question out of
mind.</p>

<p>“<em>Train!</em>” yelled Dud, who was facing the rear.
“Stop her, Jimmy!”</p>

<p>Jimmy threw his body across his ascending bar,
after one glance behind him. A short blast of warning
came from the approaching locomotive, and then
another and another. The hand-car slowed and
stopped and before it had ceased its momentum two
badly scared boys were on the ground beside it.</p>

<p>“We’ve got—to get—her off!” cried Dud.
“Quick, Jimmy!”</p>

<p>On came the train, still whistling, but now they
could hear the grating of brake-shoes as the engineer
put on the air. Dud had his end of the hand-car
clear of the rails, but at Jimmy’s end the wheels
were caught.</p>

<p>“Give me a lift—here!” panted Jimmy, and Dud
sprang to his aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>Neither dared look back up the track, but they
could feel the rails pulse as the locomotive bore down
upon them, while the screech of locked wheels was
deafening. It seemed minutes before they managed
to wrench the hand-car from the track, although it
was in reality but a matter of seconds from the
first warning blast to the instant that, pushing the
hand-car down the slope beside the railway, the
two boys literally threw themselves after it. There
was a roar, a maelstrom of dust, the sound of releasing
brake-shoes and the freight, gathering speed
again, rushed by them.</p>

<p><em>Clank-clank! Thump-thump!</em> Car after car
went past while Dud and Jimmy, white-faced,
breathless and trembling from their exertions,
crouched in a tangle of bushes beside the half-overturned
hand-car, deafened, choked and blinded with
dust, shudderingly grateful for their escape.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, some two miles distant, Grafton and
Mount Morris were battling valiantly on a sun-smitten
diamond before the gaze of nearly a thousand
excited spectators. The fourth inning was
drawing to its close. It had been a slow contest, filled
with anxious moments for both contenders. Every
inning so far had seen runners on the bases and yet
only one tally had been scored and that for the visitors.
In the first of the second a pass had been followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
by a clean hit and a bad error by Mount Morris’
second-baseman and Captain Murtha had dashed
over the plate. But since then Saylor, for the Green-and-White,
and Nate Leddy, pitching for the visitors,
had managed to stave off runs, although more
than once a hit would have spelled disaster. Neither
Saylor nor Leddy had gone unpunished, for there
had been hits aplenty for both teams, but neither
Grafton nor Mount Morris had been able to hit
safely when a hit would have meant a run. Errors
had been frequent and each team had been about
equally guilty, although the Green-and-White’s slip-ups
had proved more costly. Now, with two down
and Gordon on second, Nate Leddy was trying his
hardest to solve the mysteries of the sharply-breaking
deliveries of his rival. Here again a hit would
send a tally across, and here again the hit was not
forthcoming, for Nate, after getting Saylor in the
hole, fouled off his second strike and then lifted a
high one to first-baseman.</p>

<p>The fifth began with the tail-end of the Mount
Morris batting list coming up and Leddy beginning
to show wear. Strike-outs had been few and Nate
had in nearly every case been obliged to serve at
least seven balls. Mount Morris had displayed a
positive passion for knocking fouls. Nate’s first
two offerings were not good enough and the third
went bounding off the batsman’s cudgel into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
stand. Then came a third ball, and simultaneous
with the umpire’s decision Ben Myatt left the bench
and began to warm up with Brooks. Nate had to
let that batter go. The next one flied out to Boynton.
Then came another hit, the seventh for the
home team, and first and second were occupied.
Nate was slipping now and from the bench Coach
Sargent was watching him as a cat watches a mouse.
One ball—two balls—a strike—another ball—</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent arose and Guy Murtha hustled in
from second to the mound. Back of first base Ben
Myatt removed his coat and moved into the field.
Nate passed him the ball and Ben clapped the other
on the shoulder as he turned toward the bench.</p>

<p>“Myatt pitching for Grafton!” announced the
umpire.</p>

<p>Weston had joined Brooks and was tossing the
ball to him desultorily, his gaze on the diamond.
The cheers from the visiting contingent died away
and Ben took up the task. The batsman accepted
the first ball and slammed it across the diamond to
Nick Blake. Nick dashed to second and made the
out, but the oncoming runner from first spoiled his
throw and the double. Two down and men on first
and third. But Ben had the situation in hand and
the next batsman fouled out to Winslow.</p>

<p>Once more Grafton put runners on the bases,
Winslow first, after Blake had retired by the strike-out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
route, and then Ordway, the latter beating out
a bunt by a hair’s-breadth. But then Murtha, swinging
like a Hercules, only succeeded in driving a liner
into shortstop’s glove and Neil Ayer’s fly to right
was an easy out.</p>

<p>Mount Morris’ first-batsman struck out amidst
the joyful whoops of the Grafton supporters, but
the next man hit safely to short left and was advanced
by a bunt which Winslow, coming in for
on the run, scrambled. A double steal followed,
Gordon pegging to Winslow too late. Myatt had
trouble finding the plate and the bags were filled
again. But Fortune had not yet turned her back on
the Scarlet-and-Gray. The Mount Morris left
fielder, doing his utmost to bring off a sacrifice fly,
only hit a weak, bounding ball to the pitcher’s box
and the runner was out at the plate. But Gordon’s
throw to first was too late to get the batter. Myatt
worked a strike over and followed it with a ball.
Then a healthy swing failed and the score was two-and-one.
But a second ball followed and then a
third, and Grafton saw trouble ahead. The next
was a strike, not offered at, and Ben gathered himself
together for a final effort. When the ball left
his hand it sped straight for the center of the plate
with nothing on it but speed. There was a <em>crack</em>
of wood against leather and out in left field Hugh
Ordway, shading his eyes for an instant, turned and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
raced back. A swift turn, a change of direction to
the right and then a breathless, silent moment in the
stand. Down came the ball, Hugh stepped forward
a pace and then a mighty shout of joy and relief
arose from the flaunters of the scarlet-and-gray pennants.
With his back almost at the wall of the red-brick
dormitory, Hobo Ordway had pulled down
one of the longest flies in the history of the dual
contests!</p>

<p>The seventh began with Grafton still one lone
tally to the good. Boynton was an easy out, shortstop
to first, Star Meyer fanned, Gordon got a
lucky hit that glanced from Saylor’s glove and rolled
safely past second-baseman. Myatt received a salvo
of applause as he made his first appearance at the
plate and there were demands for a home-run. But
Ben was not the old Ben today. Those on the bench
realized that he was playing on his nerve and Mr.
Sargent viewed him anxiously. Ben let Saylor put
a strike and two balls over before he offered. Then
came the hit-and-run signal and he swung at a fairly
wide one while Gordon streaked to second. Ben
missed entirely, but the catcher’s hurried throw was
low and Gordon was safe. Ben spoiled the next one
and Saylor made it three balls and Grafton howled
and whooped expectantly. But Ben’s attempt to wallop
failed, for the ball only glanced from his stick
and rolled slowly toward third. Pitcher and third-baseman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
both scurried for it and Saylor fielded it.
It was too late to get Gordon and the pitcher pegged
across to first. Ben, running hard, scented the throw
and dived feet-foremost to base with the result that
he collided with the baseman and that youth dropped
the ball. Had Gordon started for home at that moment
he could have reached it safely, but he didn’t
and a golden opportunity was lost.</p>

<p>Nick Blake let two go by, one a strike and the
other a pitch-out. Then, on the next delivery Myatt
sprinted to second unchallenged. Nick tried to hit
but failed and found himself in the hole. Saylor
coaxed him with a drop and then a wide and high
one and Nick refused both. It had to be good then
and it was, and Nick let go at it and dashed for first,
while Gordon tore in from third and Myatt legged
it to third. But Nick’s effort was vain, for the
Mount Morris third-baseman speared the ball a
yard in the air!</p>

<p>The Green-and-White was not yet acknowledging
defeat, and proved it by the way she went after the
redoubtable Myatt in the last of the seventh. Ben
was slow and careful today, lacking his usual certainty
and dash, and after the first man at bat had
smashed a drive down the first base line for a single
the home team batters lost their awe of him and
began to make trouble. Ben retired the second man
after much trouble by making him fly out to Meyer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
and Meyer held the runner at first by a quick return.
But the next man found something to his
liking and sped it straight over second and the runner
on first went on to third. Ben’s trip around the
bases had been his undoing and he knew it, and after
he had pitched two balls to the succeeding batsman
he turned and spoke to Murtha and a consultation
followed. Mr. Sargent was already on his feet beside
the bench. A nod of his head and Guy Weston
tossed the ball to Brooks and walked toward the
mound.</p>

<p>Ben came out with hanging head and staggered
when he reached the bench, and Davy Richards, a
supporting arm around him, led him off to the dressing-room.</p>

<p>Weston sped in his warming-up deliveries and then
faced his task. A man on first and one on third, one
down and two balls on the batsman was the situation,
and Weston didn’t better it any by pitching two balls
in succession and adding a third runner to the bases!
On the bench, Mr. Sargent watched dismally.
Brunswick, his last chance now, was warming up,
but it was a question whether Brunswick could do
any better than Weston. Mr. Sargent was thinking
hard things of Dudley Baker at that moment!</p>

<p>And consequently it was something of a surprise
to him when Dud’s voice came to him across his
shoulder! “I’m terribly sorry, sir,” Dud was saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
breathlessly, “but we got left at that place where
we stopped, Logan and I, and we walked most of
the way and stole a hand-car, sir, and we just got
here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent’s surprise turned to cold disapproval.
“Very nice, Baker,” he replied scathingly. “It may
comfort you to know that you’ve probably lost the
game for us. I had meant you to pitch today,
but——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thanks, and I’m all ready to if you’ll
let me!”</p>

<p>“All ready to!” Mr. Sargent surveyed the boy’s
disheveled attire and flushed, tired face sarcastically.
“You look it! Why, you couldn’t find the
plate in the condition you are!”</p>

<p>“You try me, sir! I’ll be all right in three minutes,
sir! Just let me get into my togs, Mr. Sargent,
and give me a chance! Will you, sir, please?”</p>

<p>Weston had just served another ball to the new
batsman. Mr. Sargent hesitated only an instant.
Then: “I’ll give you a chance, Baker,” he said
quickly. “Hurry into your togs. Churchill, show
Baker where to change. I’ll hold the game up as
much as I can. But hurry!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I won’t be three minutes! And Jimmy,
sir? Logan, I mean. May he——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, only don’t stand here! Hurry, I say.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent sped Parker to where Brunswick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
was warming up and in a moment Brunswick was listening
to the coach’s instructions. In the box, Gus
Weston, ball in hand, waited uncomprehendingly.
Then Murtha took the sphere from him, slapped
him on the shoulder and sent him disgustedly to the
bench.</p>

<p>“Brunswick pitching for Grafton!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>But Brunswick’s pitching was an extraordinary affair!
If cold molasses is slow, then Brunswick was
molasses frozen to a state of solidity! It took him
the better part of sixty seconds to get from bench
to mound, and once there he had to talk long and
earnestly with Murtha and Winslow. And then he
went at his warming up very, very slowly, with a
wait between each delivery. Mount Morris protested
volubly and the stand hooted, but Brunswick
was not concerned. Before each delivery he examined
the ball rather as though he had never seen
anything just like it before, and then, having assured
himself that it was all right, he studied the
plate and the catcher, and some time later he pitched.
Just how long it took him to send those five practice
balls to Pete Gordon I don’t know, but I’m certain
that he established a record that afternoon for
dawdling! And, finally, just as he had pulled his cap
down for the twentieth time and the batsman was
impatiently pawing the dirt and waving his bat, an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
interruption occurred. A brand-new scarlet-legged
player appeared on the scene and walked toward the
box. Brunswick dropped the ball and turned away
and Mount Morris found the mystery explained.
Gordon was yielding his mask and protector to Ed
Brooks and the umpire, removing his own mask,
stepped again in front of the plate.</p>

<p>“For Grafton,” he announced, “Baker pitching,
Brooks catching! <em>Play ball!</em>”</p>

<small>WINNING HIS GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Bases filled and only one out! Two balls and
no strikes on the batsman! A hit meant two
runs across! All this Guy Murtha explained
in quick, troubled words to Dud. And Dud, tired
of face but eager-eyed, nodded quite as though Guy
had explained that it was a fine day and that the
weather prediction was for a continuation of present
conditions!</p>

<p>Then Guy went back to his place and the Grafton
sympathizers stopped cheering and Dud sped his
five balls to Brooks, each one just where he meant
it to go.</p>

<p>Once more the batsman took his place and Dud
pitched.</p>

<p>“Str-r-ike!” bawled the umpire, and waved an
arm aloft. The batter thumped the rubber with his
bat. Again Dud launched the ball forward. Again
it sped straight and true across the platter and knee-high.</p>

<p>“Str-r-ike two!”</p>

<p>The batsman grew wary. He no longer fidgeted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
but put his whole mind on the next delivery. Dud
fumbled his cap, took his half wind-up and shot his
arm to the right and around in a swing. The ball
flashed to the plate and the umpire hurled his hand
aloft with a mighty gesture.</p>

<p>“<em>He’s out!</em>”</p>

<p>Strident protest from the retreating batsman and
from the Mount Morris bench! Cheers wild and
triumphant from the Grafton seats and from the
field! And another green-stockinged player faced
his fate. A ball, a strike, another ball. Then a
drop that was swung at and never touched. Two-and-two,
and Mount Morris watching her opportunity
slip from her grasp. Then, while Dud
swung his arm up, came a quick cry from behind
him:</p>

<p>“<em>He’s off!</em>”</p>

<p>The man at third was streaking to the plate! But
so was the ball, and although the batsman swung at
it, it lodged safely in Brooks’ mitt and Brooks, dropping
to his knees, blocked the ambitious runner a foot
from the plate!</p>

<p>“Can you keep it up?” asked Mr. Sargent wonderingly
as Dud sank to the bench and Davy Richards
flourished a towel in front of his face.</p>

<p>“I think so, sir. I’m going to try awfully hard,”
answered Dud.</p>

<p>“Well, go easy on yourself this inning. Let them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
hit a little if you like. There’s another inning coming
and maybe several.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Dud’s gaze, straying along the bench,
caught sight of Jimmy, Jimmy dressed for play and
with an anxious regard fixed on the coach. “If you
could, sir,” said Dud, “I wish you’d let Logan in.
It wasn’t our fault that we got left, sir; at least, not
wholly; and Jimmy’s crazy to play!”</p>

<p>“Logan? Maybe in the next inning. I’ll see.
Here! What’s this?”</p>

<p>This was Star Meyer picking himself up from the
water bucket, having in some way tripped over one
of Jimmy’s feet as he passed. Jimmy was all sympathy
and apologies, but Star only muttered. His
haughtiness was wholly lacking and the fellows
viewed with real concern the almost abject manner
with which he righted the empty pail and retired
into the far end of the bench. But Jimmy, catching
Dud’s eye, winked wickedly.</p>

<p>The eighth passed into history without witnessing
a run for either side. Grafton got Ordway to first
on a pass and he went on a base when Ayer lifted
one to left for the second out. Then, while Boynton
was at bat, Hugh was caught napping at second
and another chance to score passed into oblivion.</p>

<p>Mount Morris’ first man got a hit and was thrown
out at second on an attempted steal, Brooks making
as pretty a peg to Murtha as one could hope to see.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
The next man struck out miserably. Then followed
a scratch hit that came near to being an error for
Blake. The next man, Saylor, flied out to Murtha
and ended the eighth.</p>

<p>Boynton started for Grafton in the ninth by beating
out a weak hit and the scarlet pennants waved
again. Meyer, bat on shoulder and stepping to the
plate, was recalled.</p>

<p>“Logan batting for Boynton!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Jimmy swung at the first ball, disdained the next
two, had a second strike called on him, started for
the next and changed his mind and was glad of it
and was finally passed when what Saylor had meant
for a strike over the inner corner went wrong.
With two on bases, Brooks was the man of the hour,
but Brooks was no hitter and only stood there while
Saylor fooled him on two slow ones that went for
strikes, wasted a wide one on him and then made
him bite at a drop that actually dusted the plate.
Although Brooks played the game to the last and
sped for his base the ball was recovered by the
catcher and got there well ahead of him.</p>

<p>Dud had as much hope of hitting safely as he had
of knocking out a home-run. And he knew very
well that he would be doing only what was expected
of him if he struck out as badly as Brooks. But he
wanted very much to do something a little better
than that. As he dug his toes and faced Saylor, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
recalled Ben Myatt’s remark that a pitcher who
could hit was pretty useful. And Dud wanted to
make himself just that! And so he tried as hard as
he knew how to keep his eyes on the pitcher and
study him and then on the ball, and study that, and
so see if—</p>

<p>“One ball!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Dud took a breath. All right so far. It had been
too high and he had known it. He wondered if Saylor
would try it again or—</p>

<p>“Str-r-r-ike!”</p>

<p>Well, that had certainly fooled him! He thought
surely it was going wide. Saylor had some curve
on that one! Dud glued his eyes to the ball once
more, swung and missed.</p>

<p>“Str-r-rike two!”</p>

<p>That was awful! He was as good as gone now!
Unless—</p>

<p>“Two balls!”</p>

<p>Perhaps Saylor would miss it this time. Then it
would be three balls and two strikes and Saylor would
have to pitch! Just why Dud offered at the next
delivery he didn’t know then and couldn’t have explained
later. It had all the ear-marks of a fast
one on the outside of the plate, but for some reason
Dud let go at it, and <a href="#i_frontis">the ball, curving inward, met
his bat fairly and screeched off into short center</a>, low
enough to have been speared by second-baseman had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
he been two yards nearer its path and long enough to
send Boynton and Jimmy hustling home. Jimmy
beat out that throw by inches only, but beat it nevertheless,
while Dud, seeing his chance, streaked to
second. And Grafton went fairly delirious with joy!</p>

<p>Nick hit safely and advanced Dud, Winslow
fouled out to the catcher and Hugh Ordway, putting
all his strength into a terrific swing, sent a screeching
fly far into right field but not far enough to
be out of reach of the guardian of that territory. A
long hard run and a brilliant catch and the half-inning
was over.</p>

<p>Mount Morris tried hard enough in that last
period to catch up, but she had little chance. Dud
had no trouble in striking out the first batsman.
The next hit safely through second base territory.
The third went out, Winslow to Ayer, and the
fourth, Mount Morris’ last hope, swung at a high
one, was fooled by a drop that he didn’t like and
that was labeled a strike, fouled off another and at
last, just as the shadow of the grandstand had
reached the edge of the plate, slammed a straight,
fast one directly at the pitcher’s box. Dud couldn’t
make the catch; it was going too hard for that;
but he knocked it down, found it leisurely enough
and tossed to Ayer. And as the big first-baseman
nestled the ball in his glove the stands flowed onto
the field and the game was over!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>Half an hour later, tired and very, very happy,
Grafton was returning home. Dud, hero of the
hour, but a very retiring, modest—even uncomfortable—hero,
was wedged between Jimmy and a car
window. There was much talk, much laughter,
much noise, and James Townsend Logan was accountable
for fully his share of it. Jimmy had just
finished recounting the history of their hand-car
adventure and the subsequent heart-breaking hike to
Greenbank to as many fellows as could cluster
within hearing. Blake, sitting on the arm of the
seat, one hand fondling Jimmy’s damp locks, put a
question.</p>

<p>“Where,” he asked, “is Star now, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned, felt carefully of a large lump
under his left eye and made answer solemnly.</p>

<p>“He’s coming by the next train. He was—er—delayed.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Nick gently, “that you didn’t—didn’t
damage him, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy turned and smiled broadly up at the questioner.</p>

<p>“You wait till you see him!” he said in a deep,
ecstatic whisper.</p>

<p>Mr. Crowley, pushing his way along the aisle,
paused to thrust a hand over Jimmy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Baker, that was playing ball, my boy,” he said
happily. “Shake hands! You pitched a fine three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
innings and, what’s more, you won your own game,
boy!”</p>

<p>Dud murmured his thanks, aware of the kindly
smiling looks from the clustered faces, and turned
his own face to the window. It occurred to him just
then that Mr. Crowley’s expression was capable of
two meanings. Yes, he told himself contentedly, he
had at last won his game!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
